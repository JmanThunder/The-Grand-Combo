EVTNAME2000000;Welcome to CoE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2000000;This modmod adds a new 1821 bookmark to Pops of Darkness, extending the timeline of the game backward by almost fifteen years (the 1836 and 1861 bookmarks are retained unchanged, play from any of the three dates!). Particularly interesting states to play from the 1821 start are Russia, Congress Poland, Gran Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, the Netherlands, Dagestan, Egypt, Persia, Greece, the Ottoman Empire, Mexico and Portugal-Brazil. Forthcoming content will expand upon America, the Ottoman Empire and others. Of course, the chief feature is an additional fourteen-odd years for the player(s) to shift the course of history. The mod also increasingly adds extra content and tweaks for various countries (notably Hungary, the Confederate States of America, Italy, Brazil, the Ottoman Empire, Greece, Persia, Yugoslavia, and others).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC2000001;The Nation of the USA is currently suffering from a bug occuring when releasing Canadian states (not Canada itself) that will then result in them requesting statehood, when multiple states do this at the same time the event will only popup once allowing you to integrate only 1 of these nations, this can easily be dodged by only releasing 1 Canadian minor in every war so they can all be integrated seperatly, this might be fixed though we arent sure yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC80000;The Russians have demanded that we acquiesce to their theft of our rightful territory. This is outrageous, but we may have no recourse but to accept their demands. If we do, they shall help ensure our sovereignty vis-à-vis the other Europeans. Also, we may be incapable of defeating them if the Russians decide to resolve this issue by force.;Les Russes exigent que nous acquiescions au vol de notre territoire légitime. C’est un outrage, mais nous n’avons pas d’autre choix que de céder à leurs exigences. Si nous cédons, nous assurerons par là notre souveraineté à l’égard des autres européens. De plus, nous serions dans l’incapacité de vaincre si les Russes décidait de résoudre la situation par la force.;Die Russen haben verlangt, dass wir ihren Diebstahl unseres rechtmäßigen Territoriums anerkennen. Dies ist unerhört, aber uns wird vermutlich keine andere Wahl bleiben, als ihren Forderungen zu entsprechen.

EVTDESC80101;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has accepted our proposal. Their border with Russia has been adjusted and the treaty signed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME80101;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA80101;Good news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC80102;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has foolishly refused our claims and threatened to execute $COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats. An outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA80102;This cannot stand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC80103;The Amban, our Imperial representative from Peking and effectively the governor of $COUNTRY$, has informed our government that $FROMCOUNTRY$ has concluded a treaty with Russia-a treaty that includes portions of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory, with now must be handed over without comment.

EVTDESC80110;A diplomat from Russia has arrived in $COUNTRY$ with an infuriating demand: they wish to readjust the borders on our north-eastern frontier, agreed upon almost two hundred years ago. They wish access to a southern port upon the Sea of Japan, meaning all of Haishenwai would be turned over to them. Any $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$-claimed territory would be handed over by us and our vassals. This is surely a wicked threat, capitalizing on our current perceived weakness. Accepting it will also mean any of our vassals in the region will have to be integrated back into our country, to avoid this situation in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC80111;Now that the rebellion in distant Xinjiang is finished, there appears to be some question as to who has ownership over the Dungan basin. The western half of the basin, in Qaratal, is occupied by the wicked Russians… but they wish control over the eastern half in Ili, as well. Should we surrender the basin peacefully, or fight for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ honour?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME80111;The Dungan Basin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC80115;$COUNTRY$ is a nation hovering between two powers that could crush us without thought. A Russian diplomat has arrived in $CAPITAL$, offering us protection in return for our fealty.

EVTDESC80120;Though tolerant of religious practices, the Hui Muslims in $PROVINCENAME$ are resentful of discrimination by the Qing government.

EVTDESC80121;Have Peace with Han Chinese! \n Down with Qing court! \n \n A rebellion has erupted in the southern province of Yunnan, led by a rebel named Du Wenxiu. Foreign ambassadors are calling this event the ‘Panthay Rebellion’, a revolt from the Muslims in Yunnan. The man’s forces have already captured Dali and driven out the Qing governor, forcing our government to deal with the matter directly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC80125;With Muslim-led unrest existing throughout the province of Xinjiang, a Tajik adventurer by the name of Yaqub Beg has led rebels to seize the capital of Kashgar and has driven Qing governors away. The situation in the frontier appears to be out of hand, with these Muslims having declared an independent state and full Jihad against the Emperor. This rebellion against our rule is being referred to as the Dungan Revolt by the Amban of Xinjiang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC80128;After rival Sufi Naqshbandi spiritual orders had fought and accused each other of various misdeeds, instead of continuing the violence they decided to use $COUNTRY$ legal system to solve the dispute. They filed opposing lawsuits through the office of the Xining Prefect and the judge in the case decided not to issue a ruling on which group was superior to the other in matters of all Islamic affairs, and urged them to behave. As a result, both groups resorted to violence. A taotai was sent by $COUNTRY$ to crush the perpetrators of the violence, which ended in several deaths. This led the involved parties in the dispute to rebel against $COUNTRY$. In Xunhua, Qinghai, masses of Hui, Dongxiang, Bao’an, and Salars were incited to revolt against the Qing by the Multi-coloured Mosque leader Ma Yonglin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC85000;There has been increasing violence against French missionaries in Korea, recently culminating in the execution of Bishop Siméon-François Berneux-head of the fledgling Korean Catholic Church-and the subsequent killing of almost all priests in the country as well as thousands of Catholic Koreans. One surviving priest fled to the Qing Empire, relaying his tale to a French war vessel which then launched a punitive expedition with the support of the French consul in Beijing. There is a call for France to go to war against Korea-but this is complicated by the fact that Korea is a tributary state of the Qing. If we press the matter, we risk war with the Koreans’ master, but if we back down it will be a great blow to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME85000;Catholics Slain in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA85000;This cannot go unpunished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB85000;We cannot afford to escalate the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85001;The foolish Koreans have begun executing Catholics within their territory, and this has included a number of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ missionaries-and now the French have demanded retribution. The problem, naturally, is that Korea is a Qing tributary. We are obligated to come to the Koreans’ defence, even if this means war with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Of course, there are those who say the Koreans have brought this on themselves. We would lose little sleep if we left them to their own devices, and earn favour with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME85001;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Retribution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA85001;The Koreans are on their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB85001;We will not abandon the Koreans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85002;One of our rulers has executed a group of French missionaries, resulting in French outrage and a punitive expedition against $COUNTRY$-which should have brought our Qing allies to our defence. Frustratingly, and perhaps not unexpectedly, the Qing have responded by severing their ties to $COUNTRY$ and abandoning us to our fate. War with the French seems likely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME85002;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Abandons $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA85002;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB85002;We must maintain good relations with the Qing, no matter what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85003;Not unexpectedly, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to abandon Korea to its fate in order to curry favour with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME85003;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Abandons Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA85003;Excellent news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85004;One of our rulers has executed a group of French missionaries, resulting in French outrage and a punitive expedition against $COUNTRY$-which has brought our Qing allies to bear. Instead of abandoning us, they have threatened war with the French should they intrude on our sovereignty. This may mean war with the French, but at least we know our allies remain strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME85004;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Will Defend $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA85004;That is a relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85005;Negotiations with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have not gone well. They are determined to protect their Korean vassals, even if it means war with France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC85010;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ vessel, surveying the Korean coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal Korean fortress. In a fury, our ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle the Koreans on land. After victory, they returned home-but word of the assault has spread. This is yet another example of Korea flaunting its disrespect for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authority. Many within the government are suggesting we demand not only an apology, but force a treaty upon the Koreans which will see their nation forced to open itself to our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME85010;The Ganghwa Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA85010;Demand an apology as well as the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC85011;A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vessel, surveying the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal fortress-who assumed the vessel to be an enemy. In a fury, their ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle our forces on land. They returned home victorious, but words of the assault has spread and now a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ delegation has arrived in $CAPITAL$ to demand compensation-in the form of an unequal treaty requiring $COUNTRY$ be opened to their influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA85011;There is nothing we can do. Sign the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB85011;Never! Let them do their worst!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85012;A Japanese vessel, surveying the Korean coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal fortress—who assumed the vessel to be an enemy. In a fury, the Japanese ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle Korean forces on land. The Japanese returned home victorious, but words of the assault has spread and now we hear tale that they have forced the Koreans to sign an unequal treaty in consequence… one which has forced them to sever tributary ties to $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA85012;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85013;The Korean government has caved to our delegation and signed the Treaty of Ganghwa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME85013;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA85013;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME85014;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA85014;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85015;We are being overwhelmed by the superior might of Japanese armaments. Despite the loss of face, we must consider offering the hated Japanese terms of our surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA85015;It seems we have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85020;With increasing frustration against government corruption and foreign influence in $COUNTRY$, a rebel movement has appeared among followers of the Tonghak or ‘Eastern Learning’ ideology. They have been stirring up the peasant classes, forming poorly-armed if numerous armies to purge the capital and rid the country of Japanese and other foreign presence. We will need to move quickly if we wish to prevent them from overthrowing the government or causing an incident with neighbouring powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME85020;Tonghak Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA85020;This cannot be allowed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85021;The unrest caused by the Tonghak movement appears to be coming to an end. The militant leaders have vanished into the countryside, and their followers have dispersed. Order is restored-for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME85021;Tonghak Rebellion Ended;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85025;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has received reports of a massive rebellion forming in Korea, serious enough that several members of the Korean government have sent an urgent call to $COUNTRY$ to intervene. Any forces we dispatch will likely provoke a response from Japan, who will fear that we are attempting to uproot their influence. This may, however, be an opportunity for $COUNTRY$ to solidify our own influence in Korea-many advisors are saying that we cannot allow the potential response from Japan stop us from acting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA85025;We must intervene in Korea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB85025;They are on their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85026;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has moved to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion currently underway in Korea. It seems likely that, should $FROMCOUNTRY$ succeed in quelling the rebellion, they will become the unquestioned masters of Korea and all but eliminate what influence we possess there. The only sensible move is to send in forces to overthrow the Korean government and replace it with one that is more firmly pro-Japanese-despite the conflict this will all but certainly spark with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME85026;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Intervenes in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA85026;Overthrow the Korean government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB85026;This is not the time to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85027;Reacting to reports that the Chinese are planning to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered $CAPITAL$ and captured the Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react. Pro-Japanese supporters have been installed in the new government, effectively rendering us a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vassal. Both rebels and loyalist forces throughout the country have reacted in rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME85027;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Forces Enter Seoul;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA85027;An outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85028;Responding to news of our intended intervention, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered Seoul and captured the Korean Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react. A pro-Japanese government has been installed, effectively rendering Korea a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vassal, with orders to end any agreements and alliances with $COUNTRY$ and ban our forces from entering their nation. This is, of course, an insult of the highest magnitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA85028;War it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB85028;This is not the time to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85029;Reacting to the Tonghak uprising, the Chinese have moved forces into Korea-entering $CAPITAL$ and effectively setting up a government under their complete control in a swift coup. That there has been no reaction from the Japanese government is surprising, just as it is frustrating that our embattled armies have had no chance to agree to this so-called ‘help’ from the Chinese. Either way, rebels and loyalists alike are enraged at this foreign intrusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME85029;Chinese Intervene in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85030;The rebellion in Korea has grown worse, and already we have reports of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ consulate under assault by rebel forces. It seems the Korean government is helpless. Considering that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ stands by doing nothing, refusing Korean appeals for help, it seems we are in a position to act-some are suggesting that we engineer a pro-Japanese coup in Seoul to install a government more firmly in our control, and prevent any possibility of an overthrow eliminating our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85031;For better or for worse, the issue of foreign claims in Korea has been settled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME85031;Foreign Claims;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC85032;In April 1948, a conference of organizations from the north and the south met in Pyongyang. The southern politicians Kim Koo and Kim Kyu-sik attended the conference and boycotted the elections in the south, as did other politicians and parties. The conference called for a united government and the withdrawal of foreign troops. Syngman Rhee and General Hodge denounced the conference. Kim Koo was assassinated the following year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC85034;During the 1956 August Faction Incident, Kim Il-sung successfully resisted efforts by the Soviet Union and China to depose him in favour of Soviet Koreans or the pro-Chinese Yan’an faction. The last Chinese troops withdrew from the country in October 1958, which is the consensus as the latest date when North Korea became effectively independent. Some scholars believe that the 1956 August incident demonstrated independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME85034;August Faction Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC85036;The April Revolution, also called the April 19 Revolution or April 19 Movement, were mass protests in South Korea against President Syngman Rhee and the First Republic from 11 to 26 April 1960. Protests opposing Rhee were started by student and labour groups in Masan on 11 April after the discovery of a local high school student killed by police during the rigged elections demonstrations in March. Popular discontent over Rhee’s autocratic rule, corruption, use of violence against political opposition, and poor development of South Korea led to large student protests in Seoul, which were violently suppressed and 180 people were killed. Rhee resigned on 26 April before fleeing to exile in the United States, and was replaced by Yun Posun, beginning the transition to the Second Republic of South Korea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC90000;As everyone knows, $CB_TARGET_NAME$ is out to get us. It’s only a matter of time before they launch an unprovoked attack, so it is only reasonable that we take steps to pre-emptively defend ourselves. As luck would have it, a report detailing their nefarious schemes has recently been ‘leaked’ to the press, and the public have rallied to our cause.;Comme tout le monde le sait, $CB_TARGET_NAME$ veut nous avoir. Ce n'est qu'une question de temps avant qu'ils lancent une attaque injustifiée, de sorte que la seule attitude raisonnable serait que nous prenions les devants par une attaque préventive. Par chance, un rapport détaillant leurs noirs desseins a récemment été lâché dans la presse, et l'opinion publique a rallié notre cause.;"Jeder weiß, dass $CB_TARGET_NAME$ uns fertig machen will. Es ist nur eine Frage der Zeit, bis sie einen unprovozierten Angriff starten. Deshalb ist es nur vernünftig, dass wir ebenfalls Schritte unternehmen, um uns präventiv zu schützen. Wie es das Glück so will, ist ein Dokument über deren schändlichen Pläne erst kürzlich über die Presse ""durchgesickert"" und die öffentliche Meinung ist zu unseren Gunsten.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90001;In a rather embarrassing blunder, several of our soldiers in the uniform of $CB_TARGET_NAME$ have been caught while trying to sneak across the border. While the rumours that their task was to stage a border incident to justify our invasion are totally unfounded, it would be wise not to provide any fresh fuel for the fire right now.;Suite à une bourde plutôt embarrassante, plusieurs de nos soldats ont été pris alors qu'ils tentaient de se faufiler à travers la frontière, revêtus des uniformes de $CB_TARGET_NAME$. Bien que les rumeurs, selon lesquelles leur tâche était de mettre en scène un incident de frontière pour justifier notre propre invasion, soient dénuées de tout fondement, il serait sage de ne pas jeter de l'huile sur le feu en ce moment.;Bei einem peinlichen Fehlschlag wurden einige unserer Soldaten mit der Uniform von $CB_TARGET_NAME$ bei dem Versuch über die Grenze zu schleichen gefangen genommen. Obwohl die Gerüchte über eine inszenierten Grenzvorfall für eine Rechtfertigung zur Invasion komplett unbegründet sind, wäre es im Moment klug für nicht noch mehr Zündstoff zu sorgen.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90002;For too long people have suffered under the malign influence of $CB_TARGET_NAME$. For the good of all involved we must reveal the evidence of $CB_TARGET_NAME$’s mismanagement to the world and bring their Sphere members under our wing for their own good.;Depuis trop longtemps la population a subi la mauvaise influence de $CB_TARGET_NAME$. Pour le bien de tous, nous devons mettre au jour la mauvaise gestion de $CB_TARGET_NAME$ et conduire les membres de leur sphère d'influence sous notre aile protectrice, pour leur propre bien.;Zu lange schon mussten die Leute unter dem unheilvollen Einfluss von $CB_TARGET_NAME$ leiden. Zum Wohle aller Beteiligten, müssen wir die Beweise von $CB_TARGET_NAME$s Misswirtschaft der Welt kundtun und die Mitglieder deren Einflussbereichs zu ihren Gunsten unter unsere Fittiche nehmen.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90003;Despite having very much non-made-up proof that $CB_TARGET_NAME$ are up to no good there seems to be no public or international support for rescuing the poor lesser nations from their sphere of influence.;Malgré de nombreuses preuves absolument pas trafiquées contre $CB_TARGET_NAME$, il ne semble pas y avoir de soutien populaire ou international en faveur de notre projet de sortir les pauvres nations rabaissées appartenant à leur sphère d'influence.;Trotz vieler nicht ausgedachter Beweise, dass $CB_TARGET_NAME$ nichts Gutes im Schilde führt, scheint es keine öffentliche und internationale Unterstützung zu geben, die armen, geringeren Nationen aus deren Einflussbereich zu retten.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90004;Without the protection of a Great Power such as ourselves anything could happen to $CB_TARGET_NAME$. In order to protect them they must be added to our Sphere of Influence, despite any short-term objections they might have. After all, if they any sense they would be Great powers too.;Sans la protection d'une grande puissance telle la nôtre, tout peut arriver à $CB_TARGET_NAME$. Afin d'être protégés, il faut qu'ils rejoignent notre sphère d'influence en dépit de toutes les objections à courte vue qu'ils peuvent avoir. Après tout, si elles faisaient sens, eux aussi seraient une grande puissance.;Ohne den Schutz einer Großmacht wie uns, könnte $CB_TARGET_NAME$ alles Mögliche wiederfahren. Um sie zu beschützen, müssen sie unserem Einflussbereich hinzugefügt werden, unabhängig von möglichen kurzfristigen Einwänden, die sie haben könnten. Immerhin fehlt ihnen das richtige Gespür für die Daseinsberechtigung als Großmacht.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90005;Although we only want to help $CB_TARGET_NAME$ by adding them to our sphere of influence they have gotten very worked up about it. While unseemly to all involved, their behaviour has rather turned international opinion against forcefully requesting they join us in our prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90006;"Why should $CB_TARGET_NAME$ get all the prime colonial land? It’s downright unfair, that’s what it is! They probably aren’t even properly exploit-educating the native population! Something must be done; we deserve our place in the sun!";Pourquoi $CB_TARGET_NAME$ devrait avoir la primeur sur toutes les terres coloniales ? C'est plus qu'injuste, voilà tout ! Ils ne sont probablement même pas capables d'exploiter—d'éduquer—convenablement la population autochtone ! Quelque chose doit être fait, nous méritons notre place au soleil !;Warum sollte $CB_TARGET_NAME$ all die guten Kolonien bekommen? Das ist hochgradig ungerecht und sonst nichts! Vermutlich schaffen sie es nicht einmal, die einheimische Bevölkerung richtig auszubeuten.. zu unterrichten. Es muss etwas getan werden. Wir verdienen einen Platz an der Sonne.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90007;Despite the modest nature of our just demands, there seems to be no international support for re-adjusting the colonial balance between ourselves and $CB_TARGET_NAME$. While this is a setback, we have no doubt that one day we will possess and empire that the sun never sets on.;En dépit de la nature modeste de nos justes demandes, il ne semble pas y avoir de consensus international pour réajuster l'équilibre colonial entre $CB_TARGET_NAME$ et nous. Malgré cet échec, nous ne doutons pas de posséder un jour un empire sur lequel le soleil ne se couchera jamais.;Trotz der moderaten Natur unserer Forderungen scheint es keine internationale Unterstützung zu geben, um die koloniale Balance zwischen uns und $CB_TARGET_NAME$ wieder herzustellen. Obwohl dies ein Rückschlag ist, haben wir keine Zweifel daran, dass wir dies eines Tages korrigieren werden auf das in unserem Reich die Sonne niemals untergeht.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90008;$CB_TARGET_NAME$ is getting too big for their boots, as all can agree. For too long they have been strutting around the world stage, thinking they can do as they will. Thankfully, at last the rest of the world agrees, and our population is solidly behind us: $CB_TARGET_NAME$ must be taken down a peg or two.;$CB_TARGET_NAME$ devient trop gros pour ses bottes, tout le monde en convient. Pendant trop longtemps, ils se sont pavanés sur de la scène mondiale, pensant qu'ils pouvaient faire ce qu'ils voulaient. Heureusement, le reste du monde est au moins d'accord avec nous, et notre population est fermement derrière nous : $CB_TARGET_NAME$ doit être rétrogradé d'un rang ou deux.;$CB_TARGET_NAME$ wird zu groß für deren Schuhgröße, wie alle zustimmen können. Schon viel zu lang sind sie über die Weltbühne stolziert und dachten, dass sie alles tun und lassen können, wie es ihnen gefällt. Glücklicherweise stimmt uns der Rest der Welt endlich zu und unsere gesamte Bevölkerung steht klar hinter uns : $CB_TARGET_NAME$ muss um ein oder zwei Stufen runtergeholt werden.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90009;While the hubris of $CB_TARGET_NAME$ is evident to us, apparently others fail to see it. Their so-called ‘sovereignty’ apparently allows them to have their own army and to do as they will without deferring to us. It has even been implied that we are the arrogant ones!;Alors que l'orgueil de $CB_TARGET_NAME$ est évident pour nous, il semble que les autres ne le voient pas. Leur soi-disant souveraineté leur permet apparemment d'avoir leur propre armée et de faire ce qu'ils veulent sans en référer à nous. On a même laissé entendre que nous serions arrogants !;"Obwohl der Größenwahn von $CB_TARGET_NAME$ absolut offensichtlich für uns ist, teilen andere scheinbar unseren Blickwinkel nicht. Ihre sogenannte ""Souveränität"" erlaubt es ihnen anscheinend, ihre eigene Armee zu haben und zu machen, was sie wollen, ohne";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90016;One of the most prominent members of Austrian aristocracy has been murdered by a Serbian assassin, a member of a group of nationalists who seek to re-join with the Serbian nation. There are definite suspicions that the Serbian government has been secretly helping these nationalists and is behind the event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90017;With the recent unrest in Hungarian lands, the local Hungarian government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC90023;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has finally given in to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ demands for local self-government. Today marks a historic occasion as the new national flag is raised in $CAPITAL$, marking a new era of $COUNTRY$’s independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90025;It has become increasingly obvious that the Tunisian government operates independently from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. We cannot continue to control them directly, and must either take measures to assert our dominance or allow them to seek their own path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90026;A group of liberal intellectuals that were responsible for the reforms of the Kanun-i Esâsî have begun stirring up resentment of the Ottoman autocracy. They demand to see the power of the throne reduced to that of a constitutional monarchy, though advisors note that giving into their demands will only anger reactionaries determined to see the Empire’s traditions maintained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90027;The government of Greece sent a demand that the state of Thessaly be returned to their rightful control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90028;The government of Serbia sent a demand for Serbian lands to be returned to their rightful control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC90035;The government of Montenegro sent a demand for their lands to be returned to their control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90036;The Ottomans continue their brutal oppression of Orthodox Christians in the Balkans. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has been receiving calls for assistance from dissidents within the Empire, and the feeling among our own Orthodox citizens is that we should take a stand to help our brothers of the faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90037;The time has come for us to expand our holdings southward into the Libyan desert.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90038;We have been approached by a Sardinian envoy, the Count of Cavour, who has made an interesting proposal: an alliance to make war against Austria, gaining Sardinia the Austrian-held provinces of Lombardy. In exchange, Sardinia would hand over Savoy and Nice to France. It is an interesting idea, and one that allows France to take a role that would not paint us as the aggressors. Shall we agree?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90039;The bloody uprising of the Sepoys has been brought to an end by the force of arms, and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control has been re-established in India. With the rebel strongholds retaken and the last pockets of resistance cleaned up, peace and stability should gradually return to the subcontinent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90040;A mutiny by a group of sepoys in the service of the British East India company has ignited lingering resentment amongst our Indian subjects into open resistance against our rule. Should this grow out of hand, all of our holdings in British India could be in jeopardy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90041;Polish peasants in Austrian-held Galicia have risen up and slaughtered wealthy landowners, leading to calls by nobility within the Free City of Kraków for a larger uprising. Many in Austria are seeing this as a reason to end Kraków’s independence once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90050;The duchies of Schleswig and Holstein have long been united and considered indivisible under the Danish crown, but a question of royal claim to the duchies combined with the Holsteiner desire to join in the larger German Confederation to the south has led to considerable difficulty for King Frederick VII. The treatment of Danish people in Schleswig living under Holsteiner domination has led to a call for the duchy to be incorporated into $COUNTRY$ proper. This is unlikely to be looked on favourably by the conservative German aristocracy in Holstein.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90051;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ crown wishes to annex the Duchy of Schleswig, which has long been considered indivisible from the Duchy of Holstein. The German aristocracy is enraged by this move. They believe their future lies with the German Confederation to the south, but the Duke of Augustenberg has a stronger claim to Schleswig than the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ King. Schleswig-Holstein must forge its own path, even if it means war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90052;Now that order has been restored to Schleswig-Holstein, international pressure is mounting to uphold treaties regarding the region. Failure to restore nominal independence to the duchies and keep them united will result in tensions between $COUNTRY$ and other European powers and possibly war with the German Confederation to the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90053;King Frederick VII has died and left no heir. According to the recently-drafted constitution, the crowns of both Denmark and Schleswig would pass to Duke Christian of Glücksburg. The crown of Holstein is more problematic, however. The House of Augustenburg claims the crowns of both Schleswig and Holstein and is calling on German support. If the new constitution is signed, Schleswig-Holstein will be officially divided. If it is not, the Danish people will almost certainly rise up against their new king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90054;The arrogant German aristocrats in Holstein have declared they intend to pursue a future with the German Confederation to the south, and consider Schleswig an indivisible part of their territory. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ militants are angrily calling for the military to step in, though some fear this may lead to war with the Germans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90055;The question of Schleswig-Holstein’s place within the German Confederation has now finally been resolved-in our favour. This will have larger repercussions, as the free German states will see that $COUNTRY$ is the true leader of the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90056;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has brought Schleswig-Holstein under German control, finally resolving its status within the confederation. This puts it in a unique position to assume leadership of the German Confederation as well as dominance over the North German states. We will need to take swift and decisive action if $COUNTRY$ is to maintain its position of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90057;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has brought Schleswig-Holstein under German control, finally resolving its status within the confederation. It’s possible that aligning ourselves with $FROMCOUNTRY$ is far more in our best interest, as well as more likely to create a united Germany under North German dominance. We should reconsider our current allegiances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90058;$FROMCOUNTRY$ is attempting to fully integrate Schleswig into its administration, in violation of its centuries-old treaty commitments to recognize the unity and autonomy of Schleswig-Holstein. They are only integrating the portion that lies outside the German Confederation, but there is a significant German population north of the new border. If we wished, we could use the ‘inseparability’ of the two duchies as an excuse to mount an invasion aimed at increasing our influence over the region and extending the German confederation to include Schleswig.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90059;$FROMCOUNTRY$ is attempting to fully integrate Schleswig-Holstein into its administration, in violation of its centuries-old treaty commitments to recognize the duchies’ autonomy. Furthermore, Holstein is a member of the German Confederation, and its duke now petitions us for support. This provocation would make an excellent excuse to mount an invasion aimed at increasing our influence over the region and extending the German confederation to include Schleswig.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90060;The Ottoman Empire has been in slow decline for much of the last century, but never has this been more apparent than in recent years. The Empire’s hold on the Balkans is weakening, and this threatens to upset the entire balance of power in Eastern Europe as Russia and other countries will inevitably be drawn into the conflict. Many in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government feel that it falls on us to call the powers of Europe together and negotiate a settlement that will restore some semblance of stability to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90061;Now that plans for the conference in $CAPITAL$ are underway, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ statesmen are busy trying to determine what our stance on the issue should be. Some feel we should favour keeping the Ottoman Empire strong, in the interest of preventing the Russians from expanding into the Middle East. This could potentially improve our relations with the Ottomans, as well. Others believe stability in the Balkans should be the priority, even though this might come at the expense of the Ottomans and our relationship with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90062;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of $COUNTRY$ to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel this is a veiled attempt to carve up our nation, and an insult, but regardless we cannot let the congress go on without our attendance. We shall see what manner of ‘negotiation’ $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90063;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of the Ottomans to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel this is a veiled attempt to bolster the shaky Empire’s hold over the Middle East and balk Russian ‘aggression’. Either way, we cannot let the congress go on without our attendance. We shall see what manner of ‘negotiation’ $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90064;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of the Ottomans to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel we should favour keeping the Ottoman Empire strong, in the interest of preventing the Russians from expanding into the Middle East. This could potentially improve our relations with the Ottomans, as well. Others believe stability in the Balkans should be the priority, even though this might come at the expense of the Ottomans and our relationship with them. Still others feel we should not take part in this veiled attempt at dismembering a sovereign nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90065;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that the Ottoman Empire needed to be kept strong, and any demands placed on it should not weaken its interests unduly. Few of the attendees were pleased, the Russians in particular, and even though the Congress favoured the Ottomans it remains to be seen whether they will bow to European pressure and uphold the Congress’s edict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90066;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans, with delegates from the Ottoman Empire also in attendance. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that creating stability in the region was best even if it came at the expense of the Empire’s power. The Russian delegates were pleased, but Ottoman delegates left in a rage. It remains to be seen whether they will bow before the Congress’s demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90067;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with mixed news: though the consensus reached was that $COUNTRY$ needed to be kept strong, they still placed numerous demands upon us that would see the political map of the Balkans rearranged. If we choose to defy the European edict, we could be facing wars from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90068;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with disheartening news: despite considerable dissension among those attending, a consensus was reached that creating stability in the Balkans is more important than $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests and sovereignty. The demands are humiliating, and will see us losing much of the Balkans if we agree. If we defy the Congress, however, we could be facing war from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90069;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent word to the European powers that it will abide by the decrees of the Congress. This proves to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government they are serious about working with the rest of Europe to maintain stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90070;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent word to the European powers that it will abide by the decrees of the Congress. This proves to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government they are serious about working with the rest of Europe to maintain stability, though it is clear they are angered by the results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90071;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has decreed that it will not abide by the demands of the Congress. The Treaty, they say, is so much worthless paper, and they refuse to give up any of their sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90075;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now it has become all too apparent, and a threat to the vision of the Ottoman Empire as master of the Orient… something which has been little more than an illusion, but which the Ottomans must either address or have it shattered forever. War will come, and Egypt will either be beaten back into place and made to heel at its master’s side or seek its own destiny as a power in its own right. Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90076;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now that independence has become all too apparent, and Ottoman mastery over the Orient is threatened. Either we must take steps to rectify the situation, and assert our dominance once and for all, or admit to the world that our power is little more than an illusion. There are those who feel that a peaceful solution is possible, and that the Egyptians might better serve as powerful allies than as implacable enemies, but that would require us to surrender our claim to Egyptian lands as well as be an affront to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ pride. \n \n §RNOTE: In case of war, you need to enforce the ‘Make Puppet’ CB on Egypt to inherit it.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90077;While we expected immediate Ottoman reprisal, it seems our former overlords are willing to negotiate. Their proposal is as follows: split the Levant between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, allow Ottoman influence to remain and they will permit our independence. Of course, while this would retain an alliance with the Empire it seems like many to hardly be true independence at all. Still, it would avoid a great deal of bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90078;Our negotiations have been successful: Egypt has agreed to partition the Levant, and we retain influence within their territory. While this spares us a great deal of bloodshed (and the possibility of an embarrassing defeat), it does mean we have lost control over the Christian Holy Land in Palestine-something that will not go over well with the powers of the world, and with Russia in particular.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90079;Despite our willingness to negotiate, Egypt has refused to accept any Ottoman influence in their territory… and also refuses to give up control over any of the Levant. We have no choice but to take it from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90080;The Turks have proven unable to retake the Levant from us, despite all the assistance they have received from the rest of Europe. Even those great powers must now admit that the Levant rightfully belongs to us, and that the ‘Sick Man of Europe’ has no claim over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90081;We have brought Egypt to its knees and restored Ottoman rule to the area. Now we must decide whether to be gracious and allow them to retain autonomy, while restricting their land and power, or whether to rule all of Egypt directly and face the possibility of rebellions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90082;An uprising in $PROVINCENAME$ has gained popularity throughout the region, spreading the unrest throughout all of $STATENAME$. Local authorities have moved swiftly in an attempt to keep the violence contained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90083;Still stinging from their defeat at the hands of the Ottomans, the Egyptian aristocracy has focused the blame on the rapid westernization of the nation and the instability they claim it has brought. They are demanding that the government cling more strongly to tradition and repeal some of these reforms and there are fears that if they are not satisfied, they may instigate a revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90084;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has declared that it will not accept Egyptian surrender, and has rejected terms that the rest of Europe feels are quite fair-instead pushing onwards to recapture all of Egypt. There are many within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government who feel this is a betrayal… $COUNTRY$ intervened to help maintain $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from collapsing, but perhaps they do not need our help at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90085;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire’s hold over its dominion is crumbling. Should the Egyptians successfully challenge Ottoman rule, it could upset the entire balance of power in the region… something that many feel would threaten $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests. Still others believe that $COUNTRY$ must remain neutral, despite the cost to our relations with the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90086;We have received word through the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ embassy pledging their support for the Ottoman Empire in our conflict with the Egyptians. This is heartening news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90087;Our forces are on the run. It seems the hated Ottomans and their allies have won the day, and we have little choice but to submit to their demands. We can try to hold out and turn the tide, but it is far more likely that Egypt will simply be carved up into pieces by the imperialists if we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90088;The Egyptians have raised the white flag, offering to abide by the Convention of London and return both Crete and the majority of the Levant to our control. Our advisors say that wresting control of the entire country is almost impossible, and that we should take the offer while we can and let the Egyptians go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90089;The Egyptians have surrendered to $FROMCOUNTRY$ and agreed to abide by the terms of the London Convention. Stability has been restored to the Orient… for now. All that remains is for us to decide whether to end hostilities with the Egyptians and return any $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ lands that we hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90090;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire’s hold over its dominion is crumbling. Egyptian diplomats have contacted ours through channels, and suggested that support in its war would be appreciated and rewarded. The Ottomans, they rightfully point out, are after all no friends of $COUNTRY$. Such an act could earn us the enmity of the Empire and its allies, however, and thus feel we must remain neutral in the conflict despite the possible benefit to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90091;We have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire. If something isn’t done it could develop into an alliance between Egypt and $FROMCOUNTRY$ that could lead to their intervention in the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90092;We have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire. If we do not object now, that support could lead to their intervention in the war. That objection, however, could also be seen as aggression on our part and harm our relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90093;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have sent a demand through diplomatic channels that we back down from our support of the Egyptians. Doing so will harm the influence we have gained in Egypt, but if we do nothing, we risk retaliation from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90094;Egypt has fallen, settling matters with the Turks through a peace treaty which has seen the Levant taken from them and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in Egypt vastly reduced. We can let the matter lie, or fight for both our stake in Egypt and our honour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90095;Despite our recent defeat, the Sultan has decided to confirm Egypt’s autonomous government. However, all the territories we had acquired outside of Egypt and Sudan are to be returned to direct Imperial administration—including, prominently, the Hedjaz and its Holy Cities. Egypt is once again merely one Ottoman vassal among many.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC90110;Jose Martí, a Cuban intellectual and radical who has spent a great deal of time organizing émigrés in the United States, has returned to the colony and declared the Manifesto de Monticristi, an exposition of the purposes and principles of the coming Cuban revolution. It seems the uprising has been in the planning for some time, and if the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government intends to remain in control of Cuba it could have a battle ahead of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90115;To hell with Spain! Remember the Maine! \n \n A riot by Cuban Spanish loyalists recently broke out in Havana, leading to the destruction of the printing presses of four local newspapers which criticized the Spanish Army. The battleship USS Maine was sent to Havana in response to fears expressed by the American consulate that Americans in Cuba might be endangered. Not long after arriving, the Maine was rocked by an explosion, killing 268 of the crew and sinking the ship in the harbour. American newspapers have leapt on the event, painting pictures of Spanish atrocities which have whipped up the public into a rage. People are calling for war against Spain and intervention in Cuba.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90120;Three Filipino priests have been executed in the Manila, charged with subversion. While the executions are said to have been just, they are now considered martyrs by the Filipino people and have inspired the creation of a literary and organization known as ‘the Propaganda Movement’. The organization consists of Filipino émigrés in Spain, primarily liberals and students, who are attempting to increase awareness of the needs of the Philippines and foster better relations between Spain and its colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90125;We have received reports from colonial officers in Manila regarding rumours of a secret organization called the ‘Katipunan’. Formed by anti-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Filipinos, they reportedly seek complete independence for the Philippines. It’s possible that limited home rule might mollify some of these revolutionaries, but nothing short of freedom will satisfy them for long. Tracking them down among sympathetic locals may prove difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90130;With the recent unrest in Cuba, the prospect of the Spanish government possibly selling the island to the United States has arisen. Should we attempt to pursue negotiations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90132;After some negotiation, conducted in secret, the Spanish have finally refused to sell Cuba. More than one member of the government has been angered by this, seeing the island as naturally falling into the American sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90133;With no small amount of fanfare, Spain has agreed to the sale of Cuba to the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90135;With conditions in our Puerto Rican colony so poor, the notion of independence has begun to spread among the local Caribenos. Reports from the colonial governor state a revolt has begun in the town of Lares, one that may be difficult to put down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90140;We have received reports of an independence movement having been formed in Puerto Rico, with an uprising having been organized in the town of Yauco. While the movement doesn’t yet have a great deal of support among local conservatives, many of whom are hoping there is still a chance to achieve independence from $COUNTRY$ through peaceful means, it’s possible that their efforts could spread if we don’t put a stop to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90141;$FROMCOUNTRY$ neglected the occupation of a large area in the Bight of Biafra to which it had historical rights, and the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ have been busily expanding their occupation at the expense of the area claimed by $FROMCOUNTRY$. That’s what they claim, at least, and the other Great Powers seem to mostly agree with them. A settlement was proposed where they would get a part of what they claim and the issue would be solved. Based on the terms of the treaty, Rio Muni would be relieved of all conflicting claims. $FROMCOUNTRY$ would be left with a mere 26,000 sq. km out of the 300,000 stretching east to the Ubangi river which they initially claimed. We can, of course, ignore all this, but our reputation would surely suffer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90145;With the loss of our colonies in Cuba and Puerto Rico, there are essentially no slaves left within our empire. At this point outlawing slavery would be largely an academic technicality, but we may as well draw up a proclamation and appease our liberal reformers in a relatively painless way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90150;After a quick and decisive war against the Danish the question about the two German speaking duchies is resolved and they are now firmly in our sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90900;We are now sufficiently advanced for the European barbarians to regard us as ‘Civilised’, and so they must respect our right to centralise and reject foreign influence throughout China.;Nous sommes suffisamment avancés pour que les barbares européens nous considèrent comme civilisés. Ainsi, ils doivent respecter notre droit à centraliser et à rejeter les influences étrangères à travers la Chine.;"Wir sind nun ausreichend fortgeschritten, damit die europäischen Barbaren uns als ""zivilisiert"" betrachten, nun müssen sie daher unser Recht auf Zentralisierung und die Ablehnung des ausländischen Einflusses in China anerkennen.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90901;The Qing’s new status has led them to demand we submit to their authority, accepting will mean an end to our independent existence.;Le nouveau statuts des Qing les a conduit à nous demander de nous soumettre à leur autorité. Accepter sonnera le glas de notre indépendance.;Der neue Status der Qing hat sie dazu verleitet von uns zu verlangen, sich ihrer Autorität zu unterwerfen. Wenn wir annehmen, bedeutet dies das Ende unserer unabhängigen Existenz.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90902;China has fractured.;;China bricht auseinander.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90904;Perhaps $FROMCOUNTRY$ has grown beyond our ability to control them? They have been far more welcoming of western ways, to the point that now they consider themselves ‘civilized’ and on par with the barbarians outside of $COUNTRY$… Indeed, they even consider themselves above us, and have thrown off $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule as if it were a bad shadow. They seek to chart an independent course, but should we let them? Should we allow them to pretend they are not part of China, and reject the heritage of a thousand thousand years?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90905;A foreign citizen-a national of one of the Great Powers-was attacked during a robbery and was killed by his assailant. We already sent apologies and made all the necessary arrangements but the injured part might use this as an excuse to demand something else from us-reparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90906;Despite the war in China, diplomats still have immunity to move around. This is necessary when negotiating peace. However, one of our delegates was attacked by an angry mob in China and the government failed to province protection. This not only sour our relations, but give us reason to demand reparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90907;For the administration of Macao, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government owe us several duties: payment of rent, customs and authorization for a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ official to inspect shipments and collect taxes. All these duties have been long overdue. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ refuses to meet their obligations and agreed terms. Today a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ envoy arrived in $CAPITAL$ offering a treaty of friendship and commerce that, if signed, would remove several of these obstacles and duties for the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government. The main points of such a treaty would be the confirmation of Macao’s ‘perpetual occupation and government’ by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, which is a disputed translation with our officials, and $FROMCOUNTRY$’s promise never to alienate Macao and dependencies without a previous agreement with us. Signing it means making a friend in Europe but not signing it might mean making some enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90908;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ governments claim that the old Treaty of Friendship and Commerce is null and void, be it by we breaking the treaty or by them claiming that they never agreed to ‘perpetual occupation and government’ of Macao. They sent us an ultimatum asking for the Macao back or to face strained relations and possibly war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90909;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats approached us proposing the lease of the Liaodong Peninsula-more specifically, Lüshun or as is known in the West, Port Arthur-for the construction of a military base and railroads. It’s a small area and it may be best to just lease it to them, as the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government doesn’t look like it will handle a refusal pacifically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90950;In these decisive days in the history of mankind, these days in which truth struggles to have itself recognized in the international chaos where powers of evil domination and imperialism have prevailed, $FROMCOUNTRY$ stands firmly to preserve its sovereignty and its dignity against imperialistic schemes of a number of nations who have uncovered their desires for domination and supremacy. In these days and in such circumstances $FROMCOUNTRY$ has resolved to show the world that when nations decide to preserve their sovereignty, they will do that all right and that when these nations are fully determined to defend their rights and maintain their dignity, they will undoubtedly succeed in achieving their ends.\n A spokesperson of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government announced the nationalization of all foreign investments in the country. Great Powers and investors demonstrated their outrage at their decision and some in our own government are calling for harsh measures to set an example.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90953;One of the regions of the Sahara we own was historically claimed by Algeria. Even if not now, they plan to put enforce these claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90954;In this part are the ten main markets, though besides these there are a vast number of others in the different parts of town. They are all squares of half a mile to the side, and along their front passes the main street, which is 40 paces in width, and runs straight from end to end of the city, crossing many bridges. At every four miles of its length comes one of those great squares of two miles in compass. In each of the squares is held a market three days a week, frequented by 40,000 or 50,000 persons, who bring there for sale every possible necessity of life. All the ten market places are encompassed by lofty houses, and below these shops is where all sorts of crafts are carried on, and all sorts of wares are on sale, including spices, jewels and pearls. \n $PROVINCENAME$ is bustling with traders, merchants buy and sell opium, making fortunes, and traders from all over China come to trade, bringing their servants and laborers to run shops or carry goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90955;With our administration of $PROVINCENAME$, we abolished opium trade and expelled the old foreign administration. As a result of these harsh policies, trade fell considerably and many Europeans vessels don’t stop in $PROVINCENAME$ anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90956;Hong Kong is turning in a large, bustling city. Merchants from all over the world come to Hong Kong to trade and the wealth moved in the city attracted people from all over China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90957;With the fall of the Bukharan Emirate, their old claims in Kandahar are slipping away and the province is firmly in our hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90958;We worked our gold mines in $PROVINCENAME$ to exhaustion and now the workers can’t find any more veils. Slowly, the mines were abandoned and the workers settled as farmers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90959;We don’t need the foreign barbarians trade, technology or friendship. We are good on our own and their influence will only corrode and corrupt our society.\n \n A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ general was quoted saying during a top military meeting. Regardless of his opinion, at this time the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military is under reformation to adopt more western methods and technologies. If we have an isolationist policy, then we won’t be able to fully test, research and take advantage of the western methods. We will be unable to apply our experiences with these new reforms back as research as these reforms will be frowned upon and looked as inferior, despite their effectiveness, a necessary evil for the protection of our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90960;We decided to request missionaries to help modernize our country, but their religion will affect our religion and the countries that we can reach. Our relation with them, our infamy and unrest in our population are all factors that play will play a role when countries decide to send us missionaries or not. It’s imperative to carefully pick what country we want to reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90961;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ruler sent an envoy requesting a few missionaries to spread the word of God in $FROMCOUNTRY$. Agreeing to this will increase our relations and influence with them and potentially convert their own ruler, but if the missionaries end up being executed by an angry mob or because of a change of heart of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ruler, our international prestige will suffer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90962;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ missionaries arrived in $CAPITAL$ today, where they will rest for a few days before starting the missionary work. Other missionaries from different countries are also scheduled to arrive to help them in their work. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government requested that we keep the situation in our country stable lest something may befall their citizens. Our councillors also advise to maintain good relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$ as bad relations might instigate hate against them in the heart of our population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC90963;$FROMCOUNTRY$ refused to send missionaries to our country, citing safety concerns for their citizens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC93744;While the French-Canadians share our colonial spirit and history, their culture and language is unique from the rest of Anglo Protestant nation. The question there for arises what is to be done with them? Should we attempt to integrate them, or would it be better off for them to have autonomy in the Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95026;The Liberian colony was founded as a homeland for freed American slaves by the American Colonization Society. Now that Liberia is considered a financial drain on its resources, the ACS is urging Liberia to proclaim independence and find its own destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95027;The Liberian colony was founded as a homeland for freed American slaves by the American Colonization Society. Now that Liberia is considered a financial drain on its resources, the ACS has convinced Liberia to request its independence from the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95028;Despite the urging of the ACS, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has denied $COUNTRY_ADJ$ independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95029;In the early 1820s a number of American ‘colonization societies’ established outposts on the Pepper Coast of Africa, to which they encouraged freed American slaves to remove themselves. In 1822 several of these colonies united and proclaimed the foundation of the new nation of Liberia, intended as a bastion of liberty on the dark continent and a perpetual home for African-Americans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95070;In the 1820s the Russian Tsar undermined the Polish constitution that had been established at the Congress of Vienna, taking steps toward integrating Poland fully into Russia. The dissolution of their democratic system led to unrest among the Polish and Lithuanian peoples of the Russian West, and an open rebellion broke out in Warsaw in November 1830.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95071;The Russian Tsar has progressively violated our constitution and intends to integrate Poland fully into Russia. Tonight, a group of patriotic officers in Warsaw has attacked the palace and seized the arsenal, declaring Poland independent. For the moment, popular sentiment supports a rebellion, and war with Russia now seems inevitable. We should seek out patrons among the great powers who might help to legitimize our uprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95072;In the past decade the Russian Tsar has undermined the Polish constitution and is taking steps toward integrating Poland fully into Russia. Now it seems that the Poles have risen up in rebellion against the Tsar and are seeking patrons among the other Powers. If we acknowledged the rebellion as legitimate it would win us some influence over a prospective independent Poland, but it would antagonize Russia and could lead to further Polish separatism. Should we give diplomatic support to the Poles?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95074;Russia’s armies have decisively defeated the Ottoman Empire and forced them to the peace table. As we feared, it appears that Russia will profit from this intervention a great deal more than $COUNTRY$ will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95075;The Ottoman Empire has been decisively defeated, and now the Christian powers of Europe have forced it to acknowledge the Greek kingdom. The Romanian principalities are now guaranteed by Russia, and Russia has annexed the mouth of the Danube and more of the Black Sea coast. Other national minorities in the Balkans will surely be encouraged to follow the example of the Greeks. This is a dark day for the Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95076;A spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the Russian Army has quickly erupted into a widespread insurrection, supported by high-ranking Polish and Lithuanian officers and politicians. The eyes of all of Europe are upon us, and if we deal with the insurgents too harshly it may hurt our relations with European powers. If we do not, however, the uprising may spread even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95085;With the recent unrest in Finnish lands, the local Finland government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95095;Since all the members of the cabinet have resigned their positions, since the $MONARCHTITLE$ has declared his inability to obtain a new government and since the constitutional monarchy has ceased to exist, the Storting hereby authorizes the cabinet that resigned today to exercise the powers held by the $MONARCHTITLE$ in accordance with the Constitution of Norway and relevant laws-with the amendments necessitated by the dissolution of the union with $COUNTRY$ under one King, resulting from the fact that the $MONARCHTITLE$ no longer functions as a Norwegian King\n In early $YEAR$, the Storting formed a coalition government and established a separate corps of consuls. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ refused to accept the law and the Norwegian cabinet resigned. When the $MONARCHTITLE$ was unable to form a new one, a crisis broke out. Initially reacting to this declaration as rebellion, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government later tried to negotiate, insisting on a plebiscite. The plebiscite resulted in 99.95% in favour of the dissolution of the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95200;A wave of nascent nationalism has begun stirring among the Turkmen peoples under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership. While the notion of a Turkmeni state is still a new concept, the possibility exists for it to spread and even lead to full rebellion in time. We must watch this carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95201;A wave of nascent nationalism has begun stirring among the Kazakh peoples under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership. While the notion of a Kazakh state is still a new concept, the possibility exists for it to spread and even lead to full rebellion in time. We must watch this carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95205;A wave of nascent nationalism has begun stirring among the Uzbek peoples under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership. While the notion of a single Uzbek state is still a new concept, the possibility exists for it to spread and even lead to full rebellion in time. We must watch this carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95206;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are clamouring for all Uzbeks to be united under our flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95210;A wave of nascent nationalism has begun stirring among the Tajik peoples under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership. While the notion of a Tajik state is still a new concept, the possibility exists for it to spread and even lead to full rebellion in time. We must watch this carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95215;A wave of nascent nationalism has begun stirring among the Kyrgyz peoples under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership. While the notion of a modern Kyrgyz state is still a new concept, the possibility exists for it to spread and even lead to full rebellion in time. We must watch this carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95216;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are clamouring for all Kyrgyz to be united under our flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95250;Brunei’s control over the southern regions has only ever been nominal, and the region has been self-governed under the Sultan of Sarawak. During a recent crisis, an Englishman by the name of James Brooke provided the Sultan invaluable assistance in restoring order, and has been bestowed with the title of governor. This ‘White Rajah’ is now effectively the ruler, and is seeking alliance with Brunei. We must either recognize the independence of an area we only barely controlled, or seek to assert our authority and perhaps anger the English in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95251;The Dutch East India Company has been slowly spreading its influence within the East Indies, and is urging our government to establish protectorates over the remaining sultanates on the islands. Indeed, they have been stirring up trouble in the region. Many within our government feel that if the Netherlands is to remain a power to be reckoned with, it must expand its colonial holdings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95252;Our mutual colonial ambitions in the East Indies are bringing us into increasing conflict with the Dutch. Tensions are particularly high surrounding the Straits of Malacca, a key channel for mercantile navigation in the East. Something must be done to resolve the growing conflict between our merchants.\n \n Our diplomats recommend defining clear ‘spheres of influence’ in the region and exchanging territories: we would control trade and colonies in the Malay Peninsula to the north, while the Dutch would control Sumatra and the islands south of the Straits. Alternatively, if we don’t mind throwing our weight around a bit, we could press the Dutch to unilaterally withdraw from the north side of the Strait, though it would damage our relations and they might refuse. What should our course be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95253;Our mutual colonial ambitions in the East Indies are bringing us into increasing conflict with the British. Tensions are particularly high surrounding the Straits of Malacca, a key channel for mercantile navigation in the East. Something must be done to resolve the growing conflict between our merchants.\n \n Now the British propose to define clear ‘spheres of influence’ in the region and exchange territories: they would control trade and colonies in the Malay Peninsula to the north, while we would control Sumatra and the islands south of the Straits. Should we accept their proposal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95254;Our mutual colonial ambitions in the East Indies are bringing us into increasing conflict with the British. Tensions are particularly high surrounding the Straits of Malacca, a key channel for mercantile navigation in the East.

Should we concede our colony?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95255;The call has been sent out for the peoples of the East Indies to unify under a common banner, for protection against foreign imperialism and to usher in a new world power to make the Europeans tremble. The people are cheering in the streets of $CAPITAL$ at the welcome news. Will $COUNTRY$ do its part?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95256;The Dutch have refused our proposal and insist that they will retain their colonies in Malacca. Perhaps we must consider other means of persuading them…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC95260;With the end of the democratic government of the United States, there is a growing feeling among many Americans that the principles upon which the country were founded no longer apply. Talk of secession is frequent, if quiet, and as unrest begins to grow it’s become increasingly more possible that liberal-minded states will attempt to pull out of the Union. If they do, we must be ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95261;A group calling themselves the Sons of Liberty has secretly formed in $PROVINCENAME$, advocating either the overthrow of the totalitarian American regime or the secession of $STATENAME$ from the Union. American law-enforcement is doing its best to hunt down these traitors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95262;With the totalitarian regime ended, Americans have taken to the streets to celebrate their regained liberties. Flags of the Sons of Liberty are in evidence everywhere. Let us hope this new era holds, and that the Union has not already been sundered beyond repair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95265;On this day in the year of our lord, $YEAR$, do we declare the Union to be defunct, a relic of the past now only a shadow of its former greatness. We delegates hereby declare ourselves the inheritors of that once-great legacy, and forever more shall we be known as the Free States of America.’ \n \n With those words, delegates from several states in the north have gathered in Philadelphia and declared their secession from the Union. Whether we can move fast enough to ensure those states never act upon the declaration, or whether others will heed the call of these so-called ‘Free States’ remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95266;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the Free States of America.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95267;Whereas once the dream of our rightful independence was crushed, we stand here in the city of Richmond to declare that it has been reborn. No longer can the South remain under the heel of the North and call it freedom-the Confederacy must rise again!’ \n \n With those words, a large group of delegates gathered in Richmond have declared the Confederate States of America reborn. At least one state has agreed to secede, and it’s possible that others will join them… now or very soon. If we are to stop this new rebellion, we will need to act quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95268;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the Confederate States of America.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95269;Whereas once our land was the frontier of America, now it is the frontier of freedom. The Oregon Country is a land where men achieve their destiny through honest toil and while believing in the equality of men. Since the Union no longer believes in the same, we hereby declare it dead.’ \n \n With these words, a group of delegates gathering in the city of Portland have declared the secession of Oregon from the Union. While other parts of the region may join them, it’s unknown whether everyone there feels the same. Clearly this rebellion must be stopped before it gains further traction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95270;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the Oregon Country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95271;We are the true heartland of America. We know things that Washington has forgotten: the value of honesty, the need for virtue, and the true meaning of freedom. What they have put aside, we shall pick up and keep close to our hearts-for now, a new nation is born. A republic that will stand the test of time as the nation we step away from has not.’ \n \n With these words, a group of delegates gathered in the city of Denver has declared the creation of the Colorado Republic. Whether more states will join their rebellion still remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95272;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the Colorado Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95273;What the fools in Washington have forgotten is that we are not their subjects. We are their allies. If they abuse us, we do not lie back and ask for forgiveness. We leave. That is what we do here today: we are forging a new alliance of equals, brothers with a common heritage who will never forget the evils that lie in tyranny and corruption.’ \n \n With these words, a group of delegates gathering in the city of Chicago have declared the formation of a ‘New American Alliance’. The state of Illinois has seceded from the Union to create it, and it’s entirely possible that others will join them if we do not act quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95274;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the New American Alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95275;Ours is a nation born of resolution. The Washington government thought it could stretch its hand across the breadth of North America, that all they touched would bow down and be forever grateful for their overlordship. We say it is not so, and stand here today to proclaim that there is a better way.’ \n \n With these words, a group of delegates gathered in Rapid City have declared the formation of the ‘Dakota Republic’. South Dakota has seceded from the Union, and it’s possible that others may soon join them. Do they not realize how short-lived their rebellion will surely be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95276;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the Dakota Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95277;We have been the subjects of despots in Mexico as well as cruel tyrants in Washington, and we stand here before you today to declare that we will stand for neither. Ours is a unique heritage, and we will move forward with the intention of celebrating it in the spirit of freedom and goodwill for all mankind.’ \n \n With these words, a group of delegates gathered in Phoenix have declared the formation of a ‘Pueblo Republic’. Arizona and New Mexico have both seceded from the union to form it, daring us to stop their rebellion-if we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95278;Our path lies in a different direction-with our hearts, our faith, and our integrity. May God watch over us and keep us safe in this perilous world.’ \n \n With these words, the leader of the Mormons has declared the formation of the independent nation of Deseret, encompassing both Utah and Nevada. They stand ready to resist any attempt by us to retake them through force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95279;Our joining of the Union was with the understanding that it meant something-we were joining a cause for true freedom in a world full of totalitarianism, a cause far greater than any we could hope to achieve on our own. We were mistaken, and now we must march forward on our own terms. May God help us all.’ \n \n With these words, the governor of California met with a large number of delegates in San Francisco and declared their state seceded from the Union-to the widespread support of many Californians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95280;We are the Lone Star State. We fought against the Mexicans and succeeded, and now we shall fight against the Yankees if they come. Let them come. Texas bows before no-one.’ \n \n With these words, the governor of Texas stood before a group of gathered delegates and declared their state seceded from the Union. Already an army of supporters is gathering in Austin, ready to fight against any reprisal from Washington.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95281;We stand here in Boston, the birthplace of this nation and the home of the Liberty Bell. Let the bell ring, let it announce to the world that our beloved homeland has fallen from grace. It is up to the Sons of Liberty to rise in its place, to fight for truth and freedom wherever its meaning has been lost. We will brook no tyrants in America.’ \n \n With these words, a group of delegates from throughout New England have declared their states seceded from the Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95282;We are the true North, the furthest frontier of the United States. We are a sturdy people who will stand on our own when called to-and that call goes out to you now. Alaska never sought its independence, but it will stand for what’s right. God help us all.’ \n \n With these words, the governor of Alaska spoke to delegates gathered at Sitka and announced that the state-cut off from support by the rest of the nation-was forced to stand on its own. Whether the state intends to one day re-join the Union if that situation changes is currently unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95283;Once we were a nation of our own, but we joined with the United States and have earned our place in the Union. We are a hard-working people who will do whatever must be done-and now we must act. Hawaii never sought its independence, but it will stand for what’s right. God help us all.’ \n \n With these words, the governor of Hawaii spoke to delegates gathered at Honolulu and announced that the state-cut off from support by the rest of the nation-was forced to stand on its own. Whether the state intends to one day re-join the Union if that situation changes is currently unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95315;With things in $COUNTRY$ so difficult, some citizens have brought up the possibility of joining the Confederation of Canada. It is a land of freedom, and together we will be more powerful than we are separately. Shall we approach their government?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95316;A delegate from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has quietly approached the Canadian government, asking for the former American state to be admitted to Confederation. While this may seem like a good idea, the Americans may see us as opportunists for accepting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95500;The colonial powers of the world have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the regulation of colonization and trade in Africa. The outcome has become known as the ‘General Act of the $CAPITAL$ Conference’, formalizing the scramble for the African continent. After this point, any civilized country will largely be seen as justified in aggression towards uncivilized African nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95501;A conference has been held in $FROMCOUNTRY$, attended by all colonial powers, to discuss the regulation of colonization and trade in Africa. A general agreement has been reached, formalizing the scramble for the African continent. After this point, any civilized country will largely be seen as justified in aggression towards uncivilized African nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95502;Word has reached $COUNTRY$ of a great meeting of colonial powers in Europe, wherein it was decided that African nations would be divided up amongst them-as if our people were little more than children’s toys discarded and left waiting to be picked up. This has caused a great deal of concern among those of our people with the knowledge to understand what this means. For others it has brought little more than resentment, as well as vows to fight for our independence when the day comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME95503;$COUNTRY$ in the Modern Age;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95503;We have seen the outsiders. They come, with guns and riches we have never seen before. What they also bring is death, and we must always be wary what lies behind their smiles.’ \n \n $COUNTRY$ stands on good terms with much of the western world, but our leaders are all too aware how quickly that could change. The Europeans believe we are not civilized, and the tone of our contact with them is slowly changing from friendly interest in trade to a strange paternalism coupled with cultural superiority. For now, $COUNTRY$ survives… but we must watch for the moment when the civilized nations decide our enslavement is the only way we can be ‘saved’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95504;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Muslims are calling for the Jihad to continue: all Islamic states of the Sahel, united under one flag!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95505;European presence in $COUNTRY$ is felt everywhere. Their traders come to $CAPITAL$ and dictate to our own merchants how trade will commence. They take what they want and pay what they wish. They tell our government what laws we may pass, and even when they do not, we must always consider how they will react to what we do. If $COUNTRY$ does not act now, they will turn our nation into a colony under our very noses-but perhaps that has already happened, and we must resign ourselves to their protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95506;Our presence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has reached the point where $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence is felt in every level of their society. They are a protectorate in all but name, and the time has come for us to determine whether that status should be made official. Shall we agree to make $FROMCOUNTRY$ a protectorate and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colony, or support their independence as a friendly ally?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95507;A disturbing report has reached us of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationals being expelled from $FROMCOUNTRY$. Indeed, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has systematically eliminated our influence-meaning we are in a position where we must either accept the humiliation of being thrown out of an uncivilized country or step in and assert our authority. There are some who say this is a golden opportunity to establish a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ protectorate, while others say $FROMCOUNTRY$ is simply not worth the trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95508;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ shipping company has come into the ownership of the Red Sea port of Assab, sold to them by a local Afar sultan. The port would make for an excellent coaling station, and perhaps even provide a base for $COUNTRY$ to expand our influence in the area. Pushing for more direct control, however, could cause tensions with Assab’s owner—who might feel they have greater right to the port than the sultan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95509;The Red Sea port of Assab has been sold to $FROMCOUNTRY$ by the local Afar sultan. They have begun to use the port as a coaling station, and fears within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are that they will use this base to expand their influence within $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95510;With the Sudan in chaos, the Ethiopians have taken advantage of the situation to regain control over the coast lands. Though we may yet regain control over the Sudan, we should consider whether the Eritreans must be punished for this trespass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95511;We must take our place among the colonial powers of Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95512;The ‘Age of Princes’ is upon us. The rulers of Ethiopia must struggle to unite the land under a single Emperor-and now it is $COUNTRY$’s time to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95514;They are coming!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95515;While not modernized with firearms, military innovations such as the assegai, the age-grade regimental system and encirclement tactics helped make the Zulu one of the most powerful nations in southern and south-eastern Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95516;With the modernization of $COUNTRY$, our country military suffered profound changes in tactics and equipment. Our old military tactics are all but ineffective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95517;After the defeat of King Mzilikazi and conquest of Matabele by $COUNTRY$, the former king of Matabele escaped. In $YEAR$, some 20,000 Ndebele, descendants of the Zulus in South Africa and led by Mzilikazi, invaded the Kalanga Rozwi Empire. Many of the Kalanga people were incorporated and the rest were made satellite territories who paid tribute to the Ndebele Kingdom. He called his new nation Mthwakazi, a Zulu word which means something which became big at conception, in Zulu ‘into ethe ithwasa yabankulu’ but the territory was called Matabeleland by Europeans. Mzilikazi organized this ethnically diverse nation into a militaristic system of regimental towns and established his capital at Bulawayo (‘the place of killing’). Mzilikazi was a statesman of considerable stature, able to weld the many conquered tribes into a strong, centralized kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95518;Matabele core territory was overrun by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers. King Mzilikazi gathered his followers and started marching north in search of territory to settle, eventually invading the Rozwi Empire and taking their lands. Many of the Kalanga people were incorporated and the rest were made satellite territories who paid tribute to the Matabele Kingdom. Mzilikazi called his new nation Mthwakazi, a Zulu word which means something which became big at conception, in Zulu ‘into ethe ithwasa yabankulu’ but the territory was called Matabeleland by Europeans. Mzilikazi organized this ethnically diverse nation into a militaristic system of regimental towns and established his capital at Bulawayo (‘the place of killing’).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95519;Around 1821, the Zulu general Mzilikazi of the Khumalo clan defied Zulu king Shaka, and set up his own kingdom. He quickly made many enemies, not only with the Zulu king, but also with the Boers, Griqua and Tswana. Defeats in several clashes convinced Mzilikazi to move north towards Swaziland. Going north and then inland westward along the watershed between the Vaal and the Limpopo rivers, Mzilikazi and his followers, the AmaNdebele, (called Matabele in English) established a Ndebele state. During this period, the Matabele left a trail of destruction in their wake. Roughly starting from 1826 to $YEAR$, widespread killings and devastation were ordered to remove all opposition. Mzilikazi reorganized the territory to establish the new Ndebele order. The death toll has never been satisfactorily determined, but the whole region became nearly depopulated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95520;Umar Tall, one of the people called Tukulor, returned from the Hajj in 1836 with the titles of El Hadj and caliph of the Tijaniyya brotherhood of the Sudan. After a long stay in Fouta-Toro, he moved to Dinguiraye. This became the staging ground for his $YEAR$ jihad. Umar Tall struck out against our weakened empire with great success-taking first Kaarta and then Segou. Umar Tall’s mujahideen readily defeated our forces, seizing Ségou itself and declaring an end to the Bambara Empire (which effectively became part of the Tukulor Empire).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95521;We exercised control and had tenuous claims over the Turkmenia region. We never managed to establish a firm control over the Turkmen nomads and now that we lost the region entirely, we find that our claims in the region are slowing being forgotten by the Great Powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95610;Advisers to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the Russians will continue their southward expansion. If we do not press north from India, we will soon find the Russians on our doorstep… And, at that point, it will be a quick step for them to invade the British Raj directly. Steps must be taken to set up puppet governments between us and them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95611;Advisers to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the British will continue their northward expansion. If we do not press south, Russia will soon have its southern borders exposed to European invasion. It does us no good to allow the British complete hegemony over Central Asia. Something must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95612;The Great Game between the British Empire and Russia has one pushing ever northward and the other pushing ever southward, with $COUNTRY$ caught in-between. Recently, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers got into a skirmish with one of our neighbours… and the resulting incident has brought the infernal gaze of one of these powers upon us, perhaps meaning war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95613;Thanks to the Great Game and its manoeuvring, tensions with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been rising. Recently, an incident occurred near their border where several $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers were attacked by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers. There were several deaths, and while the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is apologetic there are those within $COUNTRY$ who are calling for us to move in and assume control of their government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95614;It seems that $FROMCOUNTRY$ is content to accept the incident was not our intent and turn its attentions elsewhere. For the moment, $COUNTRY$ is safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95615;The country can no longer sustain itself. We must be ruled by Russia directly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95616;Unrest within $FROMCOUNTRY$ against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule has reached a boiling point, and it appears the only solution is to step in and rule them directly. Should we fail to do so, we may find $FROMCOUNTRY$ soon taken from our control and turned into a target for a foreign power’s expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95639;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in $COUNTRY$ for many years now, or perhaps we should say they are attempting to, as they have encountered considerable resistance among the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. Recently, in the southern region of Cochin China, one of the local aristocrats took offense to the intrusion of several missionaries and executed them-without our leave. Word of the deed has reached the attention of the French government, meaning their eye will almost certainly turn to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95640;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities. In $FROMCOUNTRY$, the execution of several missionaries in the Cochin China region has prompted the society to ask the French government for diplomatic intervention. So far, discussion has gone nowhere and the idea has now arisen that forming a protectorate in the area may be our only solution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95641;First, they send their ‘missionaries’ into our country, flouting our laws and offending our people with their spouted nonsense. They turn our own citizens away from the righteous path, and expect us to do nothing? $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have seized upon this excuse to demand all of Cochin China in recompense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95642;The rulers of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have foolishly refused our demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95645;We have an issue before us. The Vietnamese rule over our kingdom, and it seems certain that, very soon, either they or the Thai will demand we submit in full and are swallowed whole. The French stand on our borders, eyeing Indochina with their own ambitions. Perhaps they will make kinder rulers? Rebellion seems almost certain to end with Cambodia being torn to pieces by both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95646;King Norodom of Cambodia has sent our government a request: he asks that the Foreigners intervene in his nation, demanding it be released from Vietnamese control and made our protectorate. This would suit our goals in Indochina, though it risks war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95647;Cambodia has been under Vietnamese control since our war with Siam. Now it seems the Cambodia king has approached the Foreigners and asked for protection, and the Foreigners have agreed to offer it. They are demanding control over Cambodia, on threat of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95648;Dai Nam has refused to surrender Cambodia to us. It seems we have little choice but to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95649;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have refused to intervene. It seems we are on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95650;Many in our government believe we should press our influence in Indochina, expanding our colony there to include some of our less civilized neighbours. Perhaps the time is right for war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95652;$FROMCOUNTRY$ diplomats have arrived in $CAPITAL$ with a set of demands: namely that we should surrender control of all eastern territories not ‘rightfully ours’. This includes all land claimed by Laotian, Khmer and Vietnamese minorities. It is an outrageous demand, of course. How dare the $FROMCOUNTRY$ claim to be ‘protectors’ of these people! Yet… do we dare risk war with the Europeans?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95653;$FROMCOUNTRY$ stubbornly refuses to relinquish hold over its conquered lands. It falls on us to protect these unfortunates by use of force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95654;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has bowed before our demand. Good relations have been restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95655;We are in a difficult situation. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces cannot hold out against the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ onslaught, and they plague us at every opportunity. Perhaps we must face the realities of the situation, and sit with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ at the negotiation table to give them what they want. If we fail to do so, $COUNTRY$ is surely lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95656;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership has signed our peace treaty, granting us a state as concession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95657;The Dai Viet have refused to submit. Apparently, they will fight until the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95658;Kota Bharu was established by Sultan Muhammad II of Kelantan in $YEAR$ as Kelantan’s capital. Prior to this date, Kota Bharu was known as Kuala Kelantan. Before Kota Bharu assumed the role, the Kelantanese capital was Kota Kubang Labu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95659;The Black Flag Army was a splinter remnant of a bandit group recruited largely from soldiers of ethnic Zhuang background, who crossed the border in 1865 from Guangxi, China into Upper Tonkin, then part of the Empire of Annam (Vietnam). In 1887, the Black Flag bandits crossed the border of Luang Prabang to ransack and pillage. The small Lao kingdom was unable to defend itself and since then, they petitioned us for protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95660;Our relations with Bangkok soared over disputes of control over Laos. One of our diplomats was killed on his way from Luang Prabang to Bangkok and the central government sent ships to negotiate with the Rattanakosin king. Conflict arose when two $COUNTRY_ADJ$ ships, a sloop and a gunboat, were ordered to sail up the Chao Phraya towards Bangkok, without the permission of the Siamese: they came under fire from the fort at Paknam on $YEAR$. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ returned fire and forced their way to Bangkok. With guns trained on the Grand Palace in Bangkok, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ delivered an ultimatum to the Siamese to hand over the territory, to withdraw their garrisons there, to pay an indemnity of two million in reparation for the fighting at Paknam, and to punish those responsible for the killings in the disputed territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95661;With the end of the war, the Siamese agreed to cede Laos to $COUNTRY$, significantly expanding $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Indochina. In $YEAR$, $COUNTRY$ signed a treaty with the Siamese defining the border between Laos and their territory. The Kingdom of Laos became a protectorate, initially placed under the Governor General of Indochina.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95670;When our armies seized control of Assam, the Ahom king fled westward into British territory. We would very much like to have him in custody, so that we might eliminate all credible challenges to our sovereignty in Assam. The British colonial government, however, is hosting the fugitive king, no doubt hoping that his survival will destabilize our new holdings. We could demand his extradition, though the British would likely refuse and we could only force the issue by arms. Or, we could accept that he is lost to us and concentrate on suppressing the likely unrest in Assam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95671;When the Burmese armies seized control of Assam, the Ahom king fled westward into our territory. Burma’s rulers would very much like to have him in custody, so as to eliminate a credible challenge to their sovereignty in Assam. We’ve taken in the fugitive king, however, since his survival seems likely to destabilize Burma’s new holdings. But now a Burmese envoy has come to Calcutta demanding the king’s extradition. He offers nothing in return but ‘friendship,’ and hints at war if we refuse. If the Empire’s attention is needed elsewhere, we could deliver the king and keep the peace;or, we could take this demand as a plausible justification for eastward expansion into Burma. What should our course be?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95672;The last king of Assam is imprisoned in Ava, and the Assamese elites now have little choice but to acknowledge our rule. This is a proud day for the Burmese Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95673;The British have refused to extradite the Assamese king, and now we must decide whether to make good on our threats. We could use their refusal to justify further expansion into East Bengal—but we must realize that the British will also be viewing this conflict as an excuse to take some of our lands. Do we dare provoke the British? Or, must we back down and manage Assam as best we can?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95674;After hearing our refusal to release the Assamese king, the Burmese envoy artfully climbed down from his earlier intimations of war and took his leave. It seems that Burma dares not provoke us openly;and we four our part will happily let this king's allies sow unrest in Assam.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95675;Having faced down the British on the field of battle, we have compelled their colonial government to acknowledge our rule in Assam and turn over the fugitive king. This is a proud day for the Burmese Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95676;In the end we were unable to withstand the British forces, and our entire western frontier is now threatened. We must prepare ourselves for further difficulties with British India in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95677;Our armies are in disarray, and the British are marching on the palace. For peace the British envoy now demands that all of Assam and Arakan be transferred to British India, along with our southern coastline and a massive indemnity. This is a crushing indignity for the Empire, but the alternative appears to be total destruction. Will we sign this treaty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95678;After a crushing defeat by British colonial forces, Burma has conceded all of Assam to British India, along with Arakan and Burma’s southward coastline. The Burmese court also agrees to pay a massive indemnity to the British colonial administration, in reparation for the cost of the war. Burma’s power is shattered, and Britain ascends still further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95679;The Burmese court has outrageously refused to accept our peace terms, despite their utter inability to resist our armed forces. We should expand our demands for their territory, and perhaps commit a few atrocities against their people for good measure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96000;$COUNTRY$ is in a state of total war with one of the Great Powers of the world. In a modern age where warfare has the capability of killing millions, the very future of our nation could be at stake. The call has gone out to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people: put aside your petty differences,’ your day-to-day lives and your personal ambitions. $COUNTRY$ must pull together in this, our hour of need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96001;This should call any allies into the Great War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96002;This removes the flag once peace is achieved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96003;Gives the AI the chance to call new allies into the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96004;The constant state of war $COUNTRY$ is under has taken its toll on our people. Shortages of basic goods and the failure to deliver swift victory have worn down the enthusiasm with which the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people initially greeted the war effort. If things don’t turn around soon, we could face growing weariness and unrest within our own borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96005;Growing demonstrations in $CAPITAL$ demonstrate the prevailing attitude of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people: get us out of the war, and soon. Too many have been lost, too many sacrifices made, and all for what? The people wish to go back to their regular lives, without the constant spectre of war hanging over their heads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96006;The war effort is not going well, to put it lightly. Advisors are saying that $COUNTRY$ should sue for peace, do whatever it takes to end this war before something even more terrible happens. The people are on the brink of revolt. We must act!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96010;We have lost the war, and like vultures the victors have descended upon us. We have been forced to the bargaining table to accept humiliating terms regarding the breakup of our empire, with many of our lands simply given away, and we shall be permitted no overseas holdings whatsoever. This is a moment that shall be remembered in $COUNTRY$ for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96012;Freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96013;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has been forced to concede defeat in its war, and we have been invited to the negotiating table to discuss the potential breakup of their empire. This could potentially mean we see $COUNTRY_ADJ$ lands returned to us, though if we forego our claims it could mean salvaging a relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96014;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has been forced to concede defeat in its war, and now treaty talks have begun to discuss the breakup of their empire. As an enemy of $FROMCOUNTRY$, our place at the table is assured. At the very least, any $COUNTRY_ADJ$ lands currently in $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ possession should be returned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96015;The defeat of $FROMCOUNTRY$ in their war has forced them to the negotiating table, and one of the terms for the breakup of their empire is our release from their direct rule. This would mean casting out $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ officials and potentially turning them into an enemy. We could maintain our close ties with $FROMCOUNTRY$ even with our freedom, though this would mean passing up a chance for freedom and goodwill from $FROMCOUNTRY$’s enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96016;One of the matters discussed at the treaty talks is what to do with $FROMCOUNTRY$’s colonial holdings. They should not be allowed to keep these lands, but determining how they should be disposed of is no simple matter. For now, agreement has been reached determining some of the territory, and any remaining will have to be negotiated over in the coming year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96017;One of the matters discussed at the treaty talks is what to do with $FROMCOUNTRY$’s colonial holdings. We are not a great power, and it’s possible that even if pursue some of their colonies for our own we’ll end up with nothing… but if we do not try, we’ll end up with nothing for sure. Even so, making the attempt could be seen as aggressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96018;Freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96019;We are in the process of negotiating the disbursement of our colonies and overseas territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96020;With the war finished, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have taken to the streets of $CAPITAL$ in celebration. The toll of the war has been heavy, but today $COUNTRY$ is simply happy to be at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96022;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has been created from the ether, but the powers-that-be have determined at least some of their lands rightfully belong to $COUNTRY$ and should be returned to us. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have rejoiced at this news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96025;Now that we are in a state of total war, the idea has arisen that $COUNTRY$ should approach $FROMCOUNTRY$’s enemies to see if there are those who would join our side against them. This may mean an unholy alliance with those who might never fight at our side otherwise, but as the old saying goes: ‘The enemy of my enemy is my friend.’ If we are to win the war against $FROMCOUNTRY$, we may have to take that to heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96030;A diplomat from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us with a proposal: an alliance with them, to fight in a war against their enemy… who is certainly no friend of ours. While the alliance does not necessarily obligate us, the question really remains whether or not $COUNTRY$ even wishes to go to war. If we fight with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we stand the chance of gaining the spoils of war for ourselves. It also means we could fall with them. The choice is ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96031;We have received word from $FROMCOUNTRY$ that they have agreed to an alliance. Whether or not they will actually live up to that alliance and join us in the war remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96060;Freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96061;We have been freed as a vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96065;A diplomatic incident with one of our enemies has outraged $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. Several weeks ago, an envoy assigned to $CAPITAL$ was accused of stealing national secrets. It turned out the truth was far worse, and an investigation has unearthed a conspiracy to destabilize $COUNTRY$ and leave it weak for invasion. This has leaked out to the public, and now crowds in the capital are calling for total war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96066;The assassination of a prominent $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizen by a dissident has, after a thorough investigation, turned out to be at the instigation of an enemy power. This is but the latest in a string of incidents designed to destabilize $COUNTRY$. The results of the investigation have leaked to the public, and massive crowds gathered in the streets of $CAPITAL$ are now calling for total war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96070;According to the peace treaty, our colonies and overseas territories must be surrendered. Negotiations are currently underway as to which nations they will be ‘assigned’ to. It appears our humiliation is not yet complete.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96071;Negotiations are still underway as to which countries will obtain control over the remaining $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colonies and overseas territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96081;An isolated $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ territory has been offered to us. We should consider whether we wish to administer it, as accessing the land may be difficult according to current borders. But, then again, do we truly wish $FROMCOUNTRY$ to keep it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96085;As the armies of our former enemy depart $CAPITAL$, they leave behind a newly-installed democratic government friendly to their nation. How long this government will last is unknown, but many within $COUNTRY$ question whether ‘freedom’ imposed by a foreign power is truly that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96086;As the armies of our former enemy leave $CAPITAL$, they leave behind a newly-installed fascist government friendly to their nation. How long this government will last is unknown, but many within $COUNTRY$ seem already determined to overthrow it in the name of freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC96090;With the loss of $COUNTRY$ in the recent war, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy has received much of the blame-there have already been several assassination attempts, and calls within the government for the monarchy to step down. Sentiment in the public has turned to the notion of $COUNTRY$ becoming a democracy… though some fear this will plunge the nation into even further chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96091;The last great war ended and $FROMCOUNTRY$ was dismantled. As a punitive measure, the province of Eupen-Malmedy is being ceded to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96092;Saint Pierre & Miquelon is being offered to us as a result of the last Great War and the dismantlement of France. Since we own the closest land to it, the Great Powers argue it should be under our administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC96136;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have approached our nation with an ultimatum: dismantle $COUNTRY$ immediately, or the great powers of the world will be forced to unite against us.

The transfer of all colonies and overseas territories to the other great powers.\n 4. An agreement by $COUNTRY$ not to declare war on any other nation for a period of no less than ten years.\n \n It goes without saying that these demands are extremely humiliating, and the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people would be justifiably upset should we agree. If we do not, however, $COUNTRY$ will face a great war which even we may not be able to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC96171;Need for money led the Duke of Lucca, on the advice of Ward, who became Minister of Finance, to claim tax credits for titles dating back thirty years. All these resulted in general dissatisfaction. A liberal movement began to grow in Lucca where in $YEAR$ there was a series of demonstrations, culminating in a full-scale riot. At first Charles Louis, the Duke, tried to assert his authority, but the continuous unrest forced him to take refuge in the Villa of San Martino in Vignale. Alarmed at the sight of a crowd that wanted to submit some reforms, he signed a series of concessions. Three days later, under pressure from many citizens, he returned to Lucca, where he was welcomed triumphantly. However, he was unable to cope with the pressure and on he left for Modena. From there, he issued a decree that converted the Council of State in a Council of Regency. Some days later he abdicated in favour of the ruler of $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96172;The eclectic structure of the Altar of the Fatherland (Altare della Patria) was designed by Giuseppe Sacconi in 1885. Sculptures for it were parcelled out to established sculptors all over Italy, such as Leonardo Bistolfi and Angelo Zanelli. It was inaugurated in $YEAR$, albeit not entirely complete. The monument is to feature stairways, Corinthian columns, fountains, an equestrian sculpture of the main figure behind Italian unification and two statues of the goddess Victoria riding on quadrigas. The structure is 135 m wide and 70 m high. If the quadrigae and winged victories are included, the height is to 81 m. It has a total area of 17,000 square meters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96173;The seeds of the revolution of $YEAR$ were sown prior to the Congress of Vienna, in 1812. This was during the tumultuous Napoleonic period when the Bourbon court was forced to escape from Naples and set up its royal court in Palermo with the assistance of the English navy. The Sicilian nobles were able to take the opportunity to force on the Bourbons a new constitution for Sicily that was based on the Westminster system of parliamentary government, and was in fact quite a liberal constitution for the time. However, post Congress of Vienna, Ferdinand IV of Naples (and III of Sicily) immediately abolished the constitution upon returning the royal court to Naples. The 1848 revolution was substantially organized from, and centred in, Palermo. The popular nature of the revolt is evident in the fact that posters and notices were being handed out a full three days before the substantive acts of the revolution occurred. The rebels are storming key cities and caught up the forces of our country off guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96215;Nationalists have succeeded in taking over $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colonies in India. Our governors have been driven out and our territory lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97000;A growing dissatisfaction with the ruling government among Portugal’s poor has grown into rebellion, spurred on by popular discontent with the prohibition against burials inside churches. The instigator of the initial riots is a woman by the name of Maria, and her nickname has come to be used to represent the rebellion-which has a large contingent of peasant women among its supporters-and which has been co-opted by revolutionaries in emulation of the rebellions elsewhere in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97001;The Maria de Fonte rebellion has spread to $PROVINCENAME$, with the lower classes rising up in opposition to the ruling government. Many are calling for the government’s resignation, and there are signs that Queen Maria II may engineer a coup to restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97002;Portuguese forces have managed to restore order in the countryside, and the peasantry have been brought back under control. The danger of a royal coup has ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97003;Spurred on by the spreading revolts in Portugal, Queen Maria II has suspended the constitution and installed a reactionary government presided over by João Francisco de Saldanha Oliveira e Daun, 1st Duke of Saldanha.

EVTDESC97015;Upon returning to Lisbon from a brief trip abroad, King Carlos I and the royal family had their carriage fired upon by republican activists as they passed through the Terreiro do Paço. Three of the bullets struck and killed the King, while another fatally wounded the heir to the throne, Luis Filipe. During the turmoil, the police killed the assassins… but the King and the royal heir were not saved and were pronounced dead at the Naval Arsenal soon afterwards. Manuel, the king’s youngest son, has been quickly acclaimed as the new King of Portugal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97020;With the monarchy already weakened by the death of King Carlos, republican opponents have been able to gather considerable support in the capital. Members of the Carbonária, republican youth, and elements of the army have instigated a coup d’état in the palace. The young King Manuel and his family have reportedly escaped for exile to England, and only days later a new Portuguese Republic has been declared in Lisbon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97021;King John VI has returned to Europe from his court in Rio de Janeiro, leaving the crown prince, Dom Pedro, to govern Brazil as his viceroy. The Portuguese Cortes has produced a new draft constitution which greatly reduces the powers of the monarch and raises the sensitive question of the status of Brazil.\n While the royal court was in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil was elevated to the status of a peer kingdom united with Portugal under one monarch, and many legal and commercial restrictions from the colonial period were removed. Now, the Portuguese nobility are agitating for Brazil’s colonial status to be restored and Portugal’s primacy re-established. If Brazil is returned to colonial dependency it will greatly upset the Brazilians, who feel that they deserve to be full citizens of the Portuguese nation. But, if Brazil’s autonomy as a kingdom is respected, we face massive reactionary unrest in Portugal. What should Brazil’s status be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97022;When the new constitution reduced Brazil’s autonomy, the young prince regent was informed that he would no longer need to oversee the regional government in Rio de Janeiro. But, after months of requests, commands, and outright threats from the Cortes, Dom Pedro has flatly refused to return to the royal court in Lisboa. The crown prince insists that he will carry on as Regent of Brazil, and it seems he has the support of many aggrieved Brazilian nobles and notables, who deeply resent Brazil’s reduced status under the new constitution. The parliament is somewhat at a loss as to how it should rein in this rogue royal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97023;The die is cast. Hostilities between Brazilian independentists and Portuguese loyalists have erupted into open rebellion in America, and Dom Pedro has definitively taken the side of the rebellion. The Cortes sent the prince a letter informing him in no uncertain terms that the Brazilian government in Rio de Janeiro had been dissolved and that all who defied the Portuguese court would be punished by force. It is said that, upon reading the letter, Pedro immediately mounted his horse, drew his sword, and proclaimed Brazil’s ties to Portugal forever severed. It seems that war is now inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97024;The United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves is no more. Brazil has won its independence, and the Portuguese Empire has lost its crowning jewel. Portugal’s decline seems assured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97025;Brazil stands victorious, and is now welcomed into the community of nations as a free and sovereign state. Our onetime prince regent Dom Pedro has acquiesced to the universal demand and accepted the crown of Brazil. He is now Emperor Pedro I of Brazil, first monarch of the Brazilian Empire. May our realm prosper and grow in peace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97026;The new absolutist regime has suspended the constitution of 1822 and says it is determined to restore Brazil’s colonial dependency upon Portugal. Having had its autonomy guaranteed once, Brazil can never accept subjugation without a fight. Armies are mustering on both sides, and war will now decide the fate of Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97028;A fiery speech delivered in parliament today is the talk of the nation. The impassioned orator decried Brazil’s continued subordination to a crown four thousand miles away. Is it not time, he asked, that Brazil stood on its own and sought its own destiny? He speaks for a growing number of our people who feel that we have drifted apart from Portugal, that the Portuguese monarchy has done little to deserve our continued loyalty. Many believe it is time for full independence, and an end to the United Kingdom. Are we prepared to send an ultimatum to the Portuguese Cortes insisting on full Brazilian independence? Or, must the people’s cry for freedom go unheard?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97029;A worrisome political movement in Brazil has begun to agitate for full independence from Portugal, and it seems now to have infected the Brazilian political class, as well. The regional government in Rio de Janeiro has submitted an ultimatum to the Cortes, announcing Brazil’s intention to dissolve the United Kingdom and form an independent state. Of course, such a step would be intolerable for Portugal… unless we don’t believe we can stop it. Acceding to Brazil’s demands without a fight would humiliate Portugal and enrage our nationalists, but the only alternative now seems to be war. What is Portugal’s response?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97030;The king has died, and Portugal is faced with a dilemma. His older son, Pedro, is a constitutionalist and liberal darling, but he recently rebelled against his father and became Emperor of Brazil. The king’s younger son, Miguel, is an absolutist and has the support of the reactionary aristocracy, but he has been in exile since a failed coup attempt.\n If Pedro succeeded his father, it would bring Portugal and Brazil into a personal union, an outcome neither nation now wants. Instead, Pedro means to pass the Portuguese crown directly to his daughter, Maria da Gloria, after swearing that the Constitution will be upheld. Miguel, for his part, would take the crown and likely abolish the Cortes and the constitution, restoring absolute rule. Either ruler would provoke a backlash from the opposing camp. How will this crisis be resolved?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97031;Portugal is in the midst of a succession crisis, with late King John VI’s two sons struggling over the crown and the constitution. Pedro, previously the Brazilian Emperor, is now raising a liberal rebellion against the absolutist Miguel, and he has the support of the bourgeoisie in Porto and the Azores. With a small injection of arms and funds from us, his faction could likely restore constitutional rule in Portugal. Can we spare some ships and soldiers to covertly foment this rebellion?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97039;Portugal’s dominant position on the Iberian Peninsula makes the formation of a pan-Iberian federation a real possibility. However, an increased emphasis on the nation’s Iberian identity would likely upset our citizens overseas, who feel less attached to their Iberian heritage. Further, the formation of a Brazilian-Iberian state would seriously disturb the balance of power in Europe, upsetting the other Great Powers and risking their intervention. We could unite all of Iberia with Brazil and suffer the consequences to our reputation, or compromise by forming an Iberian Federation and devolving home rule to a Brazilian government. Or, we could turn our backs on the Iberian project and preserve our unification with Brazil. Which way does Portugal’s destiny lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97040;The regions of Upper and Lower Peru are linked by centuries of history, trade and politics. After independence, popular sentiment in both countries favoured unification to form a great Confederation of the Perus. However, Simon Bolivar opposed such a confederation because it could challenge his Colombian federation for dominance among the former Spanish territories. His forces installed a friend as president in Bolivia as the war with the Spanish ended, but the Peruvian government believed that unification could be achieved if a change of leadership in Bolivia could be arranged, perhaps by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After independence, popular sentiment in both countries favoured unification to form a great Confederation of the Perus. However, Simon Bolivar opposed such a confederation because it could challenge his Colombian federation for dominance among the former Spanish territories. Our current president is a friend of Bolivar and would never agree to unification with Peru, but a change of leadership could be arranged, if we believed it to be in the nation’s interest. If we refuse, the unionists in our nation could make things difficult for us…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97042;Bolivia has repulsed our attacks, this time. Our interest in unification remains, and they may be convinced yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97043;Peru has forced out the Colombia-friendly government in Bolivia, and even now they are beginning negotiations to establish a Peruvian confederation to our south. Can we tolerate the emergence of such a rival power in South America? Surely Peru must be punished for ousting the governor we so carefully installed in Chuqisaca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97045;Both Bolivia and Peru now agree that a confederation must be formed between our nations. Unfortunately, we cannot seem to agree upon a political structure for that new polity. Essentially, both governments intend to dominate the confederation, and both are unwilling to concede any power to the other. Negotiations are ongoing, but little progress seems to be forthcoming. Perhaps we should simplify the process by letting arms speak…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97046;Peru has been divided into two republics, Northern Peru and Southern Peru. Both are now united with Bolivia under the central government in La Paz.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97047;Lower and Upper Peru are now united in a great confederation. Our people are still getting used to the idea, and certain factions in the north strongly resist the union. More importantly, our neighbours feel threatened and are likely to intervene to disrupt our project of unification. In these early days of our new nation, we should prepare for trouble…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97050;The confederation of Peru, South Peru and Bolivia represents a threat to our interests. If the confederation is given time to solidify, they could easily become a new powerhouse in South America-and one that is no friend to $COUNTRY$. Thankfully there are signs that the confederation is unstable: the Peruvians chafe at the Bolivian leadership, and given enough incentive they might withdraw. If we act now, we might be able to stir our people against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97051;The new President of Bolivia, after the fall of the federation, proclaimed a law naming the city of the Chuquisaca as the capital of Bolivia and renaming it in honour of the revolutionary leader Antonio José de Sucre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC97060;Brazil has traditionally held the right to intervene in Uruguayan internal affairs as it sees fit, but in recent months the conservative Blanco government has proven to be increasingly intransigent. The rebel leader of the liberal Colorados, Venancio Flores, has approached us with the offer of an alliance: place him in power and Brazil has a firm ally in Uruguay once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97061;After several recent political conflicts with Brazil, they have sent an ultimatum: place the rebel leader of the Colorados in charge of the government or there will be war. There are many in the government who feel that Brazil cannot be serious. Uruguay is no threat, and they would risk angering the Platine nations with an invasion? This insulting ultimatum should be refused, according to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97062;The Uruguayan government has rejected our demands. Perhaps they underestimate our willingness to see this matter to a swift end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97065;We have no choice but to submit to the Brazilian demands. The Colorados are victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97066;The government of Uruguay has given in to our demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97070;General Juan José Flores, the president of the republic and considered by many to be its founder, has responded to his falling popularity by engaging in voting irregularities and seeking to annul the 1835 constitution in order to remain in power. This new constitution, nicknamed the ‘Carta de la Esclavitud’ (or the ‘letter of slavery’) would anger a great number of the country’s liberal populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97075;Gabriel García Moreno, called the father of Ecuadorian conservatism, has risen to power during a time of crisis. To some, he is exactly what the country needs to see it through these troubled times. To others he is a tyrant. In either case, Moreno now rules Ecuador with an iron fist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97076;The jungles of Tarauaca lie in the heart of the Amazon, and rightfully belong to $COUNTRY$. Currently there are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ settlers eager for the opportunity to settle the region and have asked for the funds to assist them, though advisors say this may cause problems with neighbouring states who also claim the territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97078;The Galapagos Islands off $COUNTRY$’s west coast have sheltered whalers in need of food, water and repairs for many decades, but they have never been permanently settled. The islands are rocky and barren, with little to recommend them as a home. Nevertheless, we should establish our legal sovereignty over them more firmly by founding a settlement and flying the flag. Perhaps we can ship some convicts over to harvest… whatever it is that grows there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC97081;In 1832 prospector Juan Godoy found a silver outcrop 50 km south of Copiapó in Chañarcillo. Godoy successfully claimed the discovered outcrop in his name and the name of José Godoy and Miguel Gallo. The finding attracted thousands of people to the place and generated significant wealth. During the heyday of Chañarcillo it produced more than 332 tons of silver ore, until the deposits begun to be exhausted in 1874. But by 1855, Copiapó was already in decline. At the end of the silver rush, rich miners had diversified their assets into banking, agriculture, trade and commerce all over the region and $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97082;Through the past decade, several companies were founded to exploit the deposits of sodium nitrate in the Bolivian and Peruvian territories, mainly with British capital.

These companies however are based in Chile or have a majority share in the hands of Chilean investors, frequently politicians. On top of that, Chilean laborers are constantly crossing borders to work on this newly found richness, stirring the Chileans to claim these deposits for themselves. Relations between the involved nations grew cold and after the declaration of monopoly over the right to explore the salitreras, a new tax on foreign production of sodium nitrate and the expropriation of a few mines, a war in the region seems more than likely to break out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral… who subsequently demanded the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. They have done so, but some advisors bring up a possibility: if $FROMCOUNTRY$ is this fearful of Spanish power, perhaps now is the time to reassert our authority over our lost Spanish colonies? Cutting $FROMCOUNTRY$ down to size may force them to submit to our rule as a vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97152;News has arrived in $CAPITAL$ regarding an incident in $FROMCOUNTRY$. According to reports, a fight broke out between two Spanish nationals and a much larger group of locals. One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral… who subsequently demanded the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. Predictably, they have refused. This is a direct challenge to Spanish authority from a former colony. If we do not react in kind, we will lose a great deal of credibility. Perhaps now is the time to reassert our authority over $FROMCOUNTRY$? Cutting them down to size may force them to submit to our rule as a vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97153;A Spanish deputy by the name of Eusebio de Salazar y Mazaredo has arrived to negotiate with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government regarding the Talambó incident. The problem, however, is that he carries with him the title of Royal Commissary. This is a title reserved for officials dealing with Spanish colonies, not ambassadors to sovereign nations. This is a deliberate insult to $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97155;We have been overrun by Spain, and now have no choice but to surrender our sovereignty to our former colonial overlords. It is a bitter day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97156;An envoy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has arrived with the expected news: they have agreed to submit themselves to Spanish rule once again, if we so choose. Some might wonder if it’s worthwhile for Spain to involve itself in South American affairs, particularly since they will ultimately try to rebel out from under us. Perhaps we have proven our point?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97160;Spanish imperialism has raised its head once again, with the Spanish throne having gone to war with a neighbour in an effort to restore their lost influence. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are rightfully worried at what this means, and there are calls for us to take a stand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97161;An envoy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has issued a protest to our involvement in South America, telling us in no uncertain terms that we are not welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97165;The United States claims it intends to protect the New World from encroachment from imperial powers in Europe. Now that Spain has made its imperialist intentions evident, perhaps it is time we put the so-called Monroe Doctrine to the test?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97166;The Monroe Doctrine dictates that the United States is responsible for protecting the western hemisphere from encroachment from imperialists in Europe-such as what Spain is doing right now in South America. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has put the Monroe Doctrine to the test and appealed to us for aid, asking for an alliance in case Spain should decide to expand its influence even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97167;With the death of Abd al-Rahman’s in $YEAR$, a dispute with Spain over the boundaries of the Spanish enclave at Ceuta emerged in Morocco. The Moroccans started to carry out attacks in Ceuta and Melilla, threatening our population and violating our territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97168;The forces of Sultan Muhammad IV of Morocco are broken, we won the war. Our diplomats worked day and night to broker the surrender terms of Morocco.\n The Sultan agreed to give us the city of Ifni and renounce his claim on Melilla, besides paying war reparations. They are completely beaten and we could push and claim the whole region of Agadir but such deal wouldn’t be seen as fair by the world or by the Moroccans, who would probably withdraw their diplomats and revoke the current agreed deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97170;In the troubled atmosphere of Sudan’s modernization, Muhammad Ahmad ibn as Sayyid Abd Allah, a fakir and religious leader, has proclaimed himself the Mahdi (or ‘guided one’). The son of a Dongola boat-builder, Muhammad Ahmad had become the disciple of Muhammad ash Sharif, the head of the Sammaniyah order. Now, combining personal magnetism with religious zealotry, he begun a war to unify the tribes in western and central Sudan, determined to expel us and restore Islam to its primitive purity. While the local government in Khartoum initially dismissed this man, further reports indicate the Mahdi possesses a great deal of magnetism-and his rallying call of driving all foreign presence out of the Sudan has gained him a large following. These Mahdists may prove to be a serious threat-especially if they capture Khartoum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97171;Followers of the Mahdi have struck again, this time in the province of $PROVINCENAME$. The religious leader’s jihad against foreigners has sparked a local rebellion, one that the authorities have had a difficult time putting down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97175;The rebellion in $STATENAME$ has been going on for far too long, and we are in danger of losing control of the colony entirely. Local militants in $PROVINCENAME$ have gone so far as to declare their nation’s independence… and while that isn’t yet true, as $STATENAME$’s state of chaos is still far too widespread, it’s an embarrassment to $COUNTRY$ and, given enough time, the militants might gain enough control to earn the colony’s independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97180;Rebels in a neighbouring colony have destabilized it enough that the people there are calling out for $COUNTRY$ to restore order. This is our land, and it seems that the western powers have all but abandoned it to chaos. So why shouldn’t we intervene? Still, there are some who say this will only damage our relationship with a power… one we cannot afford to anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97181;We have lost control of the situation in $STATENAME$. The rebels have gained sufficient control that they have ejected the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governors and declared their independence… for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97182;We are free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97185;We have restored order to our colony in $STATENAME$… at least for the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97500;The French ambassador has arrived with the following demand: they wish the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to recognize them as the sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine, turning control over all Christian sites to the French. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca signed with Russia in 1774 states that they are the sole protector of Eastern Christians, and should we agree to the French demands it will almost surely lead to conflict with the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97501;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused our demand, stating that the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca grants Russia authority over Eastern Christians and not France. More than likely they simply fear what the Russians will do. A show of force combined with the enticement of a protective alliance might compel them, though that will certainly cause friction with the Russians and there are some who say we should discontinue this venture now while we still have the chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97502;The French are not willing to abandon their claims to the Holy Land. There have been several demonstrations of naval force along our coast, and these have been combined with offers of protection against Russian retaliation. If we agree, we have a friend in France but almost certainly war with the Russians. If we refuse, very likely we will have a war with France on our hands. Which would we prefer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97503;The French have successfully pressured $FROMCOUNTRY$ into accepting their claim of authority over Christian holy sites in Palestine, authority which has traditionally belonged to us ever since the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. This is a breach of the treaty and a threat to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed that the French and the Roman Catholic Church should be the supreme Christian authority in the Holy Land, and have turned over control of Christian holy places-including the keys to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. This is in contravention to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ treaty with Russia, and will no doubt lead to conflict, but is at the same time a boon to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97505;Through a combination of military and political pressure, we now have no choice but to accept French claims in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97506;In what is perhaps a foolish move, the French have pressured the Turks into accepting their sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine… authority which has traditionally rested with the Russians since the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The question simply remains whether we should interfere. While holy sites are not our concern, trade routes through the Levant lead to India… and a Russian war with the Turks could directly threaten our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97507;Russia has control over $CAPITAL$, and much of our nation is either overrun or in complete chaos. We cannot continue. Our only option may be to surrender to the Russians and negotiate a treaty, in which we will doubtless be forced to hand over many concessions. Failure to do so, or should the Russians refuse our offer, could mean the war continuing for a very long time yet-and $COUNTRY$’s utter ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us, begging for terms of surrender. It will mean relinquishing our current war goals and sitting down with them to work out the terms of a treaty once the war is done, but we are confident they will be to $COUNTRY$’s benefit. No doubt the other powers of Europe will be far less pleased, but that is not our concern. Such a treaty will prevent this war from continuing on interminably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97509;The Russians have agreed to lay down arms. Now comes the difficult part: discovering how they wish to punish us with the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97510;The powers of Europe have met in Paris to settle the recent matter of the Crimean War. One of the provisions set out is that the newly-united Romanians would receive the Budjak in southern Bessarabia (also known as Izmail) and that we will renounce our claims in the area. Other demands are that we cede the territory of the Åland Islands to Finland as demilitarized zone. Refusing would put us at odds with the rest of Europe and perhaps lead to further war. Accepting might repair some of our relations with Romania, but would definitely be a blow to our prestige and our interests in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97511;The Ottomans have surrendered to the Russians. There is no need for our war to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97512;As we suspected, the terms of Russia’s treaty are punishing indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97515;To this day we remain a subject of the Turks. A growing movement has demanded our independence, and there are those who believe an offer of alliance with the Russians along with a guarantee of returning their lands in southern Bessarabia might entice them to support our efforts. Still others fear what a war of independence with the Turks will do to our nation. Is it worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97516;The Romanians have approached us with a deal: in exchange for our assistance in their war of independence against the Turks, they will return our lands in southern Bessarabia. It is a way to regain our influence in the region, though it does come with a steep price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97517;We have received word from the Russian government: they have agreed to support our claim of independence in exchange for Izmail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97518;We have received word from the Russian government: they have refused to support our claim of independence in exchange for Izmail. We are on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97520;The Russians have kept their part of the bargain. We should keep ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97521;Our war is over, and it has ended in failure. We remain Ottoman subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97525;The cursed Romanians have coaxed the Russians into declaring war on us in support of their independence. We cannot let this stand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97526;The Romanians have foolishly declared them independence. We must take action at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97530;As the Springtime of Nations sweeps across Europe, Romanian liberals and nationalists in $COUNTRY$, led by a group of young intellectuals and officers in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Militia, the movement has succeeded in toppling the ruling Prince Gheorghe Bibescu, who has fled the principality;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97531;Romanian liberals and nationalists in $FROMCOUNTRY$, led by a group of young intellectuals and officers in the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Militia, the movement has succeeded in toppling the ruling Prince Gheorghe Bibescu, and have established a provisional government in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97532;Revolution in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has sparked liberal uprisings in $COUNTRY$ as well. However, the revolutionaries were quickly crushed, despite the fact that the Moldavian revolutionaries were more moderate and willing to compromise in their demands for reforms than their Wallachian counterparts, as Moldavian political and social life continued to be dominated by a landed, conservative aristocracy, with the middle class still embryonic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97533;The Convention of Balta Liman of $YEAR$ was an agreement between the Russian Empire and the Ottomans regulating the political situation of the two Danubian Principalities signed during the aftermath of the Revolutions of 1848. Moldavia, which had been placed under Russian occupation in late spring 1848 following a revolutionary attempt, and Wallachia, where a liberal Provisional Government had briefly assumed power before being crushed by the Ottoman Empire, were confirmed their previous status of Ottoman suzerainty and Russian protectorate. \n \n Minor provisions were added, signifying a relative increase in Ottoman influence-namely, hospodars were no longer elected by the local National Assemblies for life, and instead appointed by the Sublime Porte for seven-year terms. The document led to the appointment of Barbu Dimitrie Stirbei as hospodar of Wallachia and Grigore Alexandru Ghica as hospodar of Moldavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97537;"In Bucharest, a fire started at the house of the Cluceress Zoita Druganeasca, near the metochion of the Buzau bishopric, at the St. Demetrius Church. Within hours the fire had spread throughout the crowded commercial centre of the city, the rest of the city was only spared from the destruction thanks to fire-fighting efforts. The fire killed 15 people and burnt down 1850 buildings, including 686 private homes, 1142 shops, 10 inns and 12 churches. \n \n After the fire was put out; the authorities began a reconstruction process. A fund was created for the rebuilding of the city. The Prince, Gheorghe Bibescu was the first to donate 6000 lei, with the rest of the institutions contributed 2,200,000 lei, as news of the fire spread across Europe, many foreign donations also contributed to the rebuilding efforts";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97550;The Federal Republic of Central America has been chaotic since its inception. Liberals who had high hopes for the union are in constant battle with conservatives, in particular the clergy and wealthy landowners, and there is a general fear of domination by Guatemala. At this point, the struggle to maintain the union seems like an almost impossible one. \n \n §RNOTE: If rebels hold the capital of their country for more than 60 days, that country will declare independence.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97551;With rebels in Nicaragua having already declared its independence from the Federal Republic, it has become next to impossible for the government to maintain order in southern Costa Rica.

EVTDESC97559;Nicaragua has seceded from the Federal Republic, sparking renewed unrest elsewhere in the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97560;The Federal Republic of Central America is rapidly disintegrating. Members of the government have met in $CAPITAL$ to discuss whether the union should be officially dissolved and the state of Guatemala declared, or whether we should fight to preserve what we have. Some consider that to be an impossible task, though liberals argue that we should not allow conservatives doom the region to a future of division and internal squabbling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97561;With our forces off valiantly facing the enemy, rebels have taken advantage of the situation and stormed $CAPITAL$. They have taken over the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and already done a great deal of damage in order to drive out foreign influence in $COUNTRY$. Without the forces to oppose them, there is little we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97562;$CAPITAL$ has been taken by the enemy, and a great deal of $COUNTRY$ is lost to our control. Many are saying that we only continue the war because our foreign masters insist that we do so, and that the time has come for us to let go of these ties-no matter the consequences. Perhaps they are right, though it seems the situation is dire for $COUNTRY$’s future no matter what we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97565;The rebels are gaining too much ground! We must call for help from our protectors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97566;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is besieged by rebels, and threatens to fall if they do not receive assistance from $COUNTRY$. They warn us that if the rebels are successful, it’s very likely that $FROMCOUNTRY$ would cease to be in $COUNTRY$’s sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97567;The danger of imminent overthrow has passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97570;Now that $COUNTRY$ is free, native $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens are beginning to protest against the colonial regime that still remains. Foreigners still hold the highest positions in the government, and have a privileged status in comparison to those they once ruled over as a colony. In $PROVINCENAME$, the recent arrest of a native for trespassing on the estate of a foreigner has led to riots-and dissension has spread throughout all of $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97571;We have received reports from the Cape Colony that there has been yet another outbreak of violence between the Xhosa natives and the colonials. This time it is evidently caused by natives returning from the diamond mines, attempting to take back control of their lands without any consideration for due process. Many within the Cape Colony believe it is time that the military moved in and took over their lands completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97580;Our young nation stands at a crossroads. We have not yet had time to hold a constituent assembly, but the provisional governing council has just received a proposal from Mexico’s transitional government: our six provinces are invited to join the new Mexican empire.\n \n Our liberals are divided: some are determined to have an independent republic, yet others approve of Mexico’s liberal trade policies and prohibition of slavery. The conservatives and the clergy, however, are united: they wish to see us back under a proper Catholic monarchy. Which way does Central America’s destiny lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97581;The Central American provisional government in Guatemala City has petitioned to join its lands to the Mexican Empire. It isn’t often that a nation can expand so dramatically without firing a shot—but, if we fear overextension, we could still turn them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97582;Conflict in the Federal Republic has reached the boiling point. The Congress is now dominated by the voices of the regional separatists, who say they intend to enact a measure authorizing each province to ‘reorganize’ its political structures—that is, to secede from the Federation. Democratic rule seems to have failed Central America, and it is unclear how the union can be preserved from here. We could try using executive power to threaten any would-be secessionists with immediate war. Or, we could simply dissolve the Congress before the measure comes to a vote and try to maintain order until the crisis passes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97600;Meaning ‘locked country’, Sakoku was the foreign relations policy of Japan instituted by the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, with no foreigner allowed to enter the country on pain of death. While some contact with westerners was permitted in the south, at the Dejima trade enclave in particular, such contact was strictly regulated and kept Japan in a state of isolation from the rest of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97601;Meaning ‘Western Learning’, Rangaku referred to the body of knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch enclave at Dejima. Despite the enforced isolation of the nation, this policy of learning allowed western influences to spread-particularly in the southern domains of Satsuma and Choshu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97605;More ‘black ships’ have appeared off our shores, these ones commanded by an American named Commodore Matthew Perry. The ill-tempered westerner is demanding an end to the Japanese policy of Sokoku—specifically trading rights in several ports, extraterritoriality for American sailors and protection for their shipwrecks. At first, he demanded to negotiate with the Emperor, but that is impossible. Thus, it falls to the Shogun to either agree to his demands, risking the appearance of weakness, or refuse and bring the wrath of the Americans upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97606;Commodore Perry has returned from his mission to Japan with a treaty in hand: we have gained numerous trade concessions, but more importantly we have cracked open the shield that is Japan’s policy of isolation. This is a great coup for American diplomacy and influence in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97607;Commodore Perry has returned from his mission to Japan with unfortunate news: they have chosen to defy his ultimatum and thumb their collective noses at our government. Should we back down now, it will be a great blow to our prestige and our influence in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97608;We are being overwhelmed by the superior might of western armaments. Despite the loss of face, we must consider offering the hated foreigners terms of our surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97609;We have formally concluded a treaty with the Japanese which will see our influence restored, and our demands for their ports to be opened to our ships to be met. Additionally, an indemnity will be placed upon their government to make up for the expense of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ war effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97610;Despite the overwhelming odds against them, the Japanese have refused our generous offer of surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97615;Revere the emperor and expel the barbarians!’ \n \n This is the slogan chanted by neo-Confucian activists, reacting to the Tokugawa shogunate’s opening of Japan to foreigners. There have been growing reports of violence all over the country, primarily against foreign visitors and statesmen but also against the shogunate itself. Each incident chips away at Tokugawa control over the daimyo and erodes relations with the western powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97616;There has been an incident in $PROVINCENAME$ where samurai, acting under the political slogan of ‘Sonno Joi’, have committed violence against foreigners conducting business in $STATENAME$. The incident has affected the Tokugawa shogunate’s relations with foreign powers, as well as incited locals into riot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97617;In an unprecedented move, the Imperial Court has issued an edict to expel the foreign barbarians present in Japan.

EVTDESC97620;Tokugawa Iesada, the 13th shogun of Japan, has died childless. This has begun a struggle within the bakufu to select a replacement. The southern tozama daimyo wish to see Tokugawa Yoshinobu become shogun, while the fudai daimyo and shogunate officials are more in favour of Tokugawa Iemochi-even though he is still but a child. It seems certain that, no matter which candidate is victorious, the disaffected daimyo will see this as a loss of power and make trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97621;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Yoshinobu as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada. This was always the preferred choice of the tozama daimyo, and perhaps it is a sign that the bakufu is not only willing to do what it must to keep Japan strong but also a sign that the tozama will be permitted more influence within the shogunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97622;Even though the fudai daimyo, the relatives and close allies of the Tokugawa clan, supported the appointment of young Iemochi as the new shogun following Iesada’s death, instead the leader of the bakufu will be Yoshinobu… a candidate favoured by the outsider tozama daimyo. The fudai are growing increasingly alarmed at the insidious influence of the tozama, and there is a stirring sentiment that perhaps the time has come for a grander change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97623;Pandering once again to the fudai daimyo, all relatives and close allies within the bakufu, the child Iemochi has been appointed shogun-instead of the more sensible candidate chosen by the tozama. It is becoming increasingly clear that a larger change is necessary. Perhaps the time has come for the Emperor to rule Japan, a single leader to bring the nation into this new era?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97624;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Iemochi as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada.

EVTDESC97625;The shogun’s Chief Minister has been assassinated by ronin samurai outside the very gates of Edo castle! Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the shogunate. This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point. Many are urging that a policy of Kobu Gattai—a union of the bakufu and the imperial court—may be required.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC97630;There are some who believe that Emperor Komei was assassinated-delivered a handkerchief laced with smallpox, perhaps by radicals who fear the possibility of compromise between the bakufu and the imperial court.

The Emperor will need to decide whether the court should move to Edo and create a new capital… or remain in Kyoto and revitalize it instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97650;The Imperial palace at Kyoto has been occupied, and our daimyo allies are on the retreat. Our advisors tell us that our only option is to lay down our arms and allow the Shogun his victory. If we are fortunate, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ clan will not be wiped out by this unfortunate turn of events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97651;Tokugawa clan forces have marched triumphantly into Kyoto, and the traitor daimyos have agreed to a permanent peace. The Bakumatsu has ended with the shogunate in control once again-victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97652;The Tokugawa shogunate has once again asserted control over Japan. A bakufu messenger has arrived at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ palace in $CAPITAL$ to demand our submission to direct rule from Edo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97660;With the ascension of Emperor Taisho, whose poor health has prompted a shift in political power from Japan’s old guard to the Imperial Diet, democratic parties are beginning to see their influence spread throughout the country. Though democratic tradition is not deeply rooted, the idea of enfranchisement as a right of the individual Japanese citizen has become far more broadly accepted. Students, university professors and journalists inspired by Western schools of thought have organized public demonstrations to demand new reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97661;A great change has taken place within the Tokugawa Shogunate, and now $COUNTRY$ must keep pace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97665;A growing dissatisfaction among the former samurai with the abolition of the han system and the resulting reduction in their personal prestige has crystallized in a rebellion. Led by one of the most prestigious samurai leaders of the former Satsuma Domain, Saigo Takamori, the rebellion has attracted a large number of followers and will be a severe challenge for the Japanese government to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97666;Saigo Takamori is dead-some say he committed seppuku after receiving a wound-and the rebellion he inspired is now ended. To many, this was the last gasp of the ancient samurai… and a new way for $COUNTRY$ on the path of progress now lies ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97670;The islands of Sakhalin and the Kurils are a natural extension of our holdings on Hokkaido, and we must seek to claim these places before the Russians do so first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97673;$COUNTRY$ has followed a militaristic path until now, determined to set ourselves against our neighbours in the interest of security-while risking that security with dangerous wars. The new $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has determined that this must change. We must follow a path of progress, and instead devote ourselves to technology and westernization if we are to remain free and whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97674;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has followed a policy of progress and westernization until now, hoping that advancing $COUNTRY$ to match the Western powers would keep us safe. We now see this is in error, and that only by an aggressive expansion of our borders can we hope to maintain the security of $COUNTRY$ proper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97675;The Chinese have fallen into warring factions, all but crumbling their power and leaving us an advantage we would be fools not to exploit. The Line of Advantage policy dictates that we should strike, and strike soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97676;Believing $COUNTRY$ to be weak, the hated Japanese have decided to strike at us and take control of our government. They shall find us a difficult target!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97677;Our nation’s policy of the Line of Advantage dictates that we must expand our borders if we are to maintain security. Naturally, our most vulnerable point lies in neighbouring Korea. They must either be brought under our direct control or made into a vassal if $COUNTRY$ is to be kept safe. Already $COUNTRY_ADJ$ generals are clamouring for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97678;The recent murder of Japanese sailors off the coast of Formosa has given rise to a question within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government: should we use this excuse to step in and wrest control of the southern island? The Line of Advantage is clear, dictating that the land would be invaluable to our goals. But are we willing to risk such a war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97679;After the recent murders of a number of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ sailors off the coast of Formosa, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has delivered a demand: turn over the island, for the sake of their security, or it shall be war between $FROMCOUNTRY$ and $COUNTRY$. We know this is just an excuse for their militarist expansion… but can we stand up against their might?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97680;Japan has quarrelled with Russia before over the rule of Sakhalin Island. Now, our influence in China and Korea has led to renewed friction between our nations. The Line of Advantage dictates that we must extend our control over the whole of Sakhalin and establish a stronger northern border. But are we willing to risk war with a European power?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97681;The warmongers in the Japanese government are now demanding that Russia cede Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands entirely to them. To give up so much territory without a fight would make us look very weak, but Japan’s might has grown tremendously in recent decades. Can we risk a war in the Pacific?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97682;The farmers and merchants are unmolested, and live without fear, going their own way, and sympathizing with us… So that already we have been able to bring some land into cultivation. We pray that this portion of the Empire may be conferred upon our late lord, Tokugawa Kamenosuke, and in that case, we shall repay your beneficence by our faithful guardianship of the northern gate.’ \n Enomoto, President of the Republic of Ezo, now made a petition to the Imperial Court to be allowed to develop Ezo and maintain the traditions of the samurai unmolested in the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97683;After the defeat of the forces of the Tokugawa Shogunate in the Boshin War, a part of the former Shogun’s navy led by Admiral Enomoto Takeaki fled to the northern island of Ezo, together with several thousand soldiers and a handful of French military advisors and their leader, Jules Brunet. On $YEAR$, the independent ‘Republic of Ezo’ was proclaimed, with a government organization based on that of the United States. Elections were based on universal suffrage among the samurai class. This was the first election ever held in Japan, where a feudal structure under an emperor with military warlords was the norm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97684;The Republic of Ezo has ended, and with it, all their claims on Ezo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97685;On the night of 7 July, the Japanese units stationed at Fengtai crossed the border to conduct military exercises. Japanese and Chinese forces outside the town of Wanping, a walled town southwest of Beijing, exchanged fire at approximately 23:00. The exact cause of this incident remains unknown. When a Japanese soldier, Private Shimura Kikujiro, failed to return to his post, Chinese regimental commander Ji Xingwen received a message from the Japanese demanding permission to enter Wanping to search for the missing soldier. The Chinese refused. Although Private Shimura returned to his unit, by this point both sides were mobilising, with the Japanese deploying reinforcements and surrounding Wanping.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97686;By 1945, the Japanese had suffered a string of defeats for nearly two years in the South West Pacific, the Marianas campaign, and the Philippines campaign. In July 1944, following the loss of Saipan, General Hideki Tojo was replaced as prime minister by General Kuniaki Koiso, who declared that the Philippines would be the site of the decisive battle. After the Japanese loss of the Philippines, Koiso in turn was replaced by Admiral Kantaro Suzuki. The Allies captured the nearby islands of Iwo Jima and Okinawa in the first half of 1945. Okinawa was to be a staging area for Operation Downfall, the Allied invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. Following Germany’s defeat, the Soviet Union began quietly redeploying its battle-hardened European forces to the Far East, in addition to about forty divisions that had been stationed there since 1941, as a counterbalance to the million-strong Kwantung Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97687;In 1945, with the surrender of Japan, the United Nations developed plans for a trusteeship administration, the Soviet Union administering the peninsula north of the 38th parallel and the United States administering the south. The politics of the Cold War resulted in the 1948 establishment of two separate governments, North Korea and South Korea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97688;The Chinese-Japanese dispute in July 1931 known as the Wanpaoshan Incident was followed by the Mukden Incident. On 18 September 1931 the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, which had decided upon a policy of localizing the incident, communicated its decision to the Kwantung Army command. However, Kwantung Army commander-in-chief General Shigeru Honjo instead ordered his forces to proceed to expand operations all along the South Manchuria Railway. Under orders from Lieutenant General Jiro Tamon, troops of the 2nd Division moved up the rail line and captured virtually every city along its 730-mile length in a matter of days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97689;The Inner Mongolian Campaign in the period from 1933 to 1936 were part of the ongoing invasion of northern China by the Empire of Japan prior to the official start of hostilities in the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1931, the invasion of Manchuria secured the creation of the puppet state of Manchukuo and in 1933, Operation Nekka detached the province of Jehol from the Republic of China. Blocked from further advance south by the Tanggu Truce, the Imperial Japanese Army turned its attention west, towards the Inner Mongolian provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, with the goal of establishing a northern China buffer state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97690;Unfortunately, the imperial Japanese army failed to occupy the Chinese Inner Mongolian lands in the last 3 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97691;Our interests is to exchange western land with eastern provinces. We will return Guihua Tumed to China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97693;Formed on May 12, 1936, the Mongol Military Government had Prince Yondonwangchug of Ulanqab as its first chairman. It was renamed in October 1937 as the Mongol United Autonomous Government. On September 1, 1939, the predominantly Han Chinese governments of South Chahar and North Shanxi were merged with the Mongol United Autonomous Government, creating the new Mengjiang United Autonomous Government. The capital was established at Zhangbei, near Kalgan, with the government’s control extending around Hohhot. On August 4, 1941, it was again renamed the Mongolian Autonomous Federation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97694;The early 20th century saw a period of Taisho democracy (1912-1926), but the 1920s saw a fragile democracy buckle under a political shift towards statism, the passing of laws against political dissent and a series of attempted coups. This process accelerated during the 1930s, spawning a number of new Radical Nationalist groups which shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. Japanese expansionism and militarization along with the totalitarianism and ultra-nationalism reshaped the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97700;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots have risen up in $FROMCOUNTRY$, and have gained control of the capital. They send word they wish to bring all our lost provinces back to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control. Agreeing would mean risking war, but refusing would mean angering our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98000;The Zulus have slaughtered a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regiment that entered their territory without our authority. While we had not been seeking a war with the Zulus, now our hand is forced. We must either back down and apologize, or see this through to the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98001;The time has come to consider joining the South African union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98002;Our colonial governor in South Africa declared an annexation of the Transvaal via special warrant several years ago, one that the Boers have stubbornly resisted. Both Transvaal and the Oranje Free State have considerable resources which would be of value to $COUNTRY$, and we must consider the idea that keeping them out of the hands of competitors for African dominance is just as much reason to annex them as using those resources for our ourselves. The Boer resistance has proven embarrassing. If we do not answer this with force, it will make the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ look weak to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98003;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have gone to war with the Transvaal, and many Boers are fearful that $COUNTRY$ will surely be next. They are crying out to our government to ally with the Transvaalers and stop the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from taking away their lands and their rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98004;We control the entire Cape Colony. There is no question now as to who the masters are in South Africa: the Boers. The time has come for us to end the war and unite the Boers under a single flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98005;We have been approached by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats desperate for help in their war. Though they loathe to do so, they are asking for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ protection. If we provide it, it does mean we establish an excellent claim over their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98006;With ‘the Great Trek’ underway, many of the Boers are eager to leave the Cape Colony behind and travel to either the Transvaal or the Oranje Free State where they feel they will be free to pursue their own interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98007;There has been general discontent among the Hungarians, and a group of young revolutionaries have appeared to demand a number of concessions including freedom of the press. Giving them even that will not satisfy them completely, but it might give the government time to put down this rebellion before it begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98008;A group of Czech radical democrats attempted to overthrow the government in a coup. They were unsuccessful, but their actions have inspired their countrymen to rise up in demand of freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98100;The treatment of slaves in Cuba has become increasingly harsh after recent unrest, culminating in the so-called ‘Ladder Conspiracy’ which relates to a method of torture involving tying a slave to a ladder and whipping them until they confess or die. Reformists in the colony have been calling for a change in Spanish policy and an end to the slave trade there. Failure to do so could result in more uprisings, but bowing to such pressure could have serious repercussions back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98105;Cuban sugar mill owner Carlos Manuel de Céspedes has issued the ‘Grito de Yara’, the ‘Cry of Yara’, declaring Cuban independence from $COUNTRY$ and freedom for his slaves. The man has many followers, and his call has spread rapidly throughout the colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98200;The Boers are descendants of Dutch settlers in the eastern Cape Colony, and they have never sat well with $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. More and more of them are leaving their farmsteads and moving to the east and the north-east, encroaching on territory traditionally ruled by the Xhosa and the Basotho. Conflict with those native peoples appears to be inevitable, as perhaps is conflict with the Boers themselves should we allow any lands they claim to remain independent. As far as the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government is concerned, the Boers are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ subjects… no matter where they go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98205;The Boers are eager to get away from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule, slowly leaving the lands of the Cape Colony and heading both east and north into the African wilds. The ones heading east are encroaching on Zulu territory, however, and it seems there is no end to them. They possess firearms, but we have the superior manpower… and all our chiefs agree on one thing: if we do not do something about the Boers now, they will dominate our territory and turn the Zulu people into colonial subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98206;The Boer encroachment into Zulu lands has provoked a reaction: the Battle of Blood River, prompted by the massacre of Piet Retief and his fellow pioneers after they attempted to negotiate borders for the new Natal settlement. The Voortrekkers won a decisive victory at the battle, and have now carved out a new colony-with the only question remaining whether the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ will recognize their independence or continue to treat them as subjects of the crown. Either way, further conflict seems certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98207;The Boers which have trekked eastward into Zulu lands have reached a surprising settlement with the natives: they have staked out permanent borders for their new colony, and done so in relative peace. The real question remains whether we will allow this new Natalia Republic to stand. The Boers are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ subjects, after all, and their existence will no doubt draw more Boers to their side… perhaps providing a threat to our African ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98210;The Boers of Natalia are once again chafing under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule, resenting the idea that even though they left the Cape Colony they have not escaped the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ crown. There have been several altercations with $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military forces, and the recommendation of the colonial government is that Natal be annexed before the situation grows worse. If we do not, then we must allow the Boers to find their own way-and suffer the loss to our prestige this would entail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98211;After a series of altercations between $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial forces and the Boer militia, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has decided to cut its losses and allow Natal its independence. Finally, we will control our own destiny, away from $FROMCOUNTRY$ now and forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98212;After a series of altercations between $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial forces and the Boer militia, we have received a demand from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government that Natalia be annexed into the Cape Colony. For all our struggles to create our own land, they yet follow us and refuse us independence! So now we are faced with a choice: submit and move on, to find a place beyond their reach once more, or defy them and risk war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98213;We have received word from the Natalian government defying our annexation. Now we must either go to war or stand down in humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98215;The Boers have been slowly trekking north from the Cape Colony into areas normally claimed by the Basotho. After a number of skirmishes with natives, they have come to dominate the Orange River valley and established a new colony-one that is still technically under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ jurisdiction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98216;We have endured the presence of the Boers, colonists who resent the British and who have been trekking north to avoid their rule, for several decades now. We even thought it was possible to co-exist peacefully. After a number of skirmishes, all ending with our defeat at the hands of their firearms, they have taken over our land in the Orange Valley and declared it their own. This is an outrage… yet what can we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98220;The Boers have been slowly trekking north from the Cape Colony into areas normally claimed by the Ndebele. After a number of skirmishes with natives, they have come to dominate the Transvaal and established a new colony-one that is still technically under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ jurisdiction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC98227;With ‘the Great Trek’ underway, many of the Boers are eager to leave $PROVINCENAME$ behind and establish new homes outside of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. The Dorsland Trek (Thirstland Trek) was the collective name of a series of explorations undertaken by Boer settlers to South-West Africa rather than to the Orange Free State and the South African Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98230;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial authorities have met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to determine the requirements for our independence. They wish to see $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ remain strong, and would see us abandon any laws allowing slavery or the ‘unethical’ treatment of foreigners working in our territory (‘uitlanders’, as they are called). While our independence is a foregone conclusion, we must decide just how much we abide by their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98235;Migrants have been moving in large numbers through our African colonies on their way to the newly incorporated town of ‘Johannesburg’, on the edge of the Witwatersrand mountains, where a major gold rush is taking place. The massive influx of foreign residents to the area is causing trouble along our borders and friction between our governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98236;Gold has been discovered in the Kimberley province, leading to claims from both the Transvaal and Oranje governments that the region rightfully belongs to them. Mediation by the colonial government has led to Kimberley being awarded to the griquas—who have subsequently consented to annexation by $COUNTRY$. This has led to considerable bad blood between the Boer and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98240;The time has come to consider joining the South African union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98241;We have been approached by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats desperate for help in their war. Though they loathe to do so, they are asking for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ protection. If we provide it, it does mean we establish an excellent claim over their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC98247;The Boers have proven far more resilient than we ever would have thought possible, and now we face the humiliating prospect of surrendering the Cape Colony to them. It seems we have little choice, with the war going so badly and Cape Town already occupied. All we can do is decide whether we will pursue a conciliatory path with the Boers and perhaps make them future allies or aim at returning in the future and reclaiming what has been lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98248;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent negotiators to work out the terms of their surrender. The tone is one of reconciliation, and it is clear the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ wishes to build good relations with us after the business of this war is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98249;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent negotiators to work out the terms of their surrender. The tone of the talks has been very bitter, and it’s clear the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government will do all it can to return and trouble us again in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98250;The Zulus have slaughtered a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regiment that entered their territory without our authority. While we had not been seeking a war with the Zulus, now our hand is forced. We must either back down and apologize, or see this through to the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98255;Once again, conflict with the native Xhosa has flared into violence in our Cape Colony. A band of Xhosa warriors spilled across the border, stealing cattle and burning down a host of British farmsteads. Colonial citizens are demanding that the governor take action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98256;We have received reports from the Cape Colony that there has been yet another outbreak of violence between the Xhosa natives and the colonials. This time it is evidently caused by natives returning from the diamond mines, attempting to take back control of their lands without any consideration for due process. Many within the Cape Colony believe it is time that the military moved in and took over their lands completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98260;Other European nations have an eye on the region of Namaqualand, directly to the north of our holdings in the Cape Colony. To forestall their ambitions, it has been recommended that we establish an enclave at Walvis Bay and incorporate it into our southern colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98261;Many British settlers are pushing north of the Cape Colony into areas only tenuously claimed by our government. We should consider increasing our presence in the region and establishing greater colonial government, before another country comes and claims it instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98262;In $YEAR$, Erasmus Jacobs found a small brilliant pebble on the banks of the Orange River, on the farm De Kalk leased from local griquas, near Hopetown, which was his father’s farm. He showed the pebble to his father who sold it. It proved to be a 21.25 carat diamond, and became known as the Eureka. The Cape Colony, Transvaal, Orange Free State and the griqua leader Nikolaas Waterboer all laid claim to the diamond fields. The Free State Boers in particular wanted the area as it lay inside the natural borders created by Orange and Vaal Rivers. Following the mediation that was overseen by the governor of Natal, the Keate Award went in favour of Waterboer, who placed himself under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ protection.!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98300;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, the people are all too keenly aware that the nation exists in a state of war. Debates in $CAPITAL$ rage over the state of the war, though the overwhelming feeling is that now more than ever citizens should be supporting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. Still, there are some who believe that now is the perfect time for change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98301;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, there is a general sense that things are not going to proceed smoothly. A sense of change is in the air, and while not everyone wants that change it seems there are many who have leapt upon the election as a chance to make it happen. A recent riot in $CAPITAL$ was only barely kept under control, and debates elsewhere in $COUNTRY$ are threatening to erupt into further violence as neither side is willing to budge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98302;$COUNTRY$ has its share of problems-and as the current election gets underway, there is a sense among many that the current government is to blame. Justified or not, that anger has instilled a sense that a regime change may be in the offing. Those who previously had never considered voting for any other party than the one in power are now considering doing just that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98303;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election gets underway, it becomes clear it will be a contentious one. The issues are clear and the battle lines between parties drawn, and there are those who believe that while violence may not be the result the toppling of the current $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regime could be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98304;With the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election underway, supporters of the current regime have rallied in $CAPITAL$. They claim that stability is required to deal with the problems facing $COUNTRY$, and are actively trying to shout down opposition. Whether this will mean a victory in the current election is unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98305;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election is underway, and so far, it has proceeded smoothly.

EVTDESC98600;There has been an increasing desire among the people of $COUNTRY$ to gain our full independence. Crowds gathering in $CAPITAL$ have demanded an end to rule by our distant overlords, and while many in the government are sympathetic with their cries there are also those who fear such a demand could lead to war. Any attempts to achieve independence should ideally take a diplomatic route first, with friendly ties maintained if peaceful separation becomes a reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98605;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ arrived in $CAPITAL$ this month, presenting a formal request for their full independence from $COUNTRY$. They assure us that they fully intend to maintain ties with our nation, and have agreed to move forward as $COUNTRY_ADJ$ allies, but that they desire their freedom even so. There are many who feel such a request is beyond the pale and must be refused out of hand. Still others say that if $FROMCOUNTRY$ is denied, we could be facing a rebellion-and is it not better than to have a friendly ally than a recalcitrant and unwilling subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98606;Not unexpectedly, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has denied our request for independence. It seems our only option is rebellion-as unrealistic as some claim that option to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98607;Our diplomacy has proven successful: $COUNTRY$ has been granted full autonomy, on the condition that friendly ties be maintained with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to cheer on our Independence Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98608;It appears the threat of a war of independence was enough to secure $COUNTRY$’s freedom. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to cheer on our Independence Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98610;It appears the time for diplomacy has ended. We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government that they have demanded independence-or it will be war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98611;Since $COUNTRY$ was denied its independence, there has been talk of open rebellion in the streets of $CAPITAL$. Fighting against our overlords might surely result in us being crushed, however. Since we have no recourse, secretly approaching some of the enemies of our overlord might gain us some allies in the war to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98612;Representatives from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, asking to set up an alliance with $COUNTRY$ should their demand for independence go unheeded. So far, they say, diplomatic efforts have proven fruitless… so $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assistance would be invaluable to them, and perhaps gain us a new ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98613;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to our secret alliance. Whether they will indeed help once the war begins remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98614;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused our request. Hopefully they don’t inform our overlords of our intent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98620;The Ottoman government had a number of policies regarding the treatment of Christians within the Empire which were considered oppressive: the capitulation tax, known as the Jizya, as well as controls over Christians which did not permit them to become soldiers or hold public office. It was not until the Hatt-i Humayun in 1856-also known as the Imperial Reform Edict, part of the Tanzimat Reforms-that things actually began to improve for minorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98621;Recently the Young Ottomans have been pushing for reform in the millet system, the governmental system under which the Empire’s territories are allowed to govern themselves. The Young Ottomans say that the Albanians have been loyal servants to the Empire and their millets deserve equal treatment to those of the Turks. This would also indicate a willingness to embrace European ideals. Reactionaries have rejected this notion, suggesting the Empire embrace the Bedouin population instead. This would indicate a commitment by the Empire towards traditional values.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98622;The Young Ottomans have begun campaigning for equality to be granted to Bosnian citizens-a European culture which is also Muslim, and the embracing of which would further indicate an alignment towards Europe. Reactionaries have been quick to suggest that if equality is going to be granted to any distant group, it should be the Maghrebi. Doing so would indicate an alignment towards reclaiming the Empire’s former expanse and away from Europe and its dangerous ideas. Appeasing both groups appears to be impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98625;A group of liberal intellectuals known as the ‘Young Ottomans’, led by the statesman reformer Midhat Pasha and influenced by the Liberal Revolutions elsewhere in Europe, have proposed a new constitution—the ‘Kanûn-i Esâsî’ or ‘Basic Law’—which would see an elected parliament created, would limit the powers of the Sultan, and speed up the Tanzimat Reforms. Conservative members of the Ottoman government claim that giving into these liberals will only speed up the erosion of long-held traditions, while others say that the reforms are sorely needed to stave off the decline of the Empire at the hands of nationalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98626;The current state of unrest within the Empire has reached the point where the Sultan has been advised to abrogate the Ottoman Constitution. Absolute power must be returned to the monarchy in order to stamp out the militants-and while there are those who say that such action will only foster more unrest, there are others who are all too aware that failing to do so will make the Sultan look weak. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that reactionaries might seek to restore the monarchy by force-or, even worse, seek to abolish it altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98630;With the recent loss of European territories, nationalists within $COUNTRY$ have been inspired to rise up. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials are concerned we could be seeing a string of rebellions in the years to come, and already the army is scrambling to contain any efforts at rebel organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98635;Spurred on by the continuing lack of reform, Ottoman liberals have radicalized into the ‘Young Turks’. They seek to restore the constitutional monarchy, by force if need be, and there are those who have advised the government that these liberals must be dealt with harshly before they grow into a real problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98636;Turkish liberals have grown increasingly defiant of the Ottoman monarchy-to the point where they suggest that the Sultan must be overthrown, replaced with a modern republic. They reject the notion of Ottomanism, saying it has already led to the Empire’s decline, and that the way to restoring the nation’s glory is to put the good of the Turkish people ahead of all other concerns… including religious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98640;The Ottoman monarchy has been overthrown, and now $COUNTRY$ stands in its place. The concept of Ottomanism, an Empire formed of diverse cultures and religions, has been set aside in favour of a nation built by and for the Turkish people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98641;The Imams of Yemen are religiously consecrated leaders belonging to the Zaidiyyah branch of Shia Islam. They established a blend of religious and secular rule in parts of Yemen in 897 and now the Rassid dynasty ruled for almost a millennium. However, the power of the imamate declined in the 18th and 19th century. The territory controlled by the imams shrank successively after the late 17th century, and the lucrative coffee trade declined with new producers in other parts of the world. The imamate became a ‘quasi-state’ with an inherent tension between tribes and government, and between tribal culture and learned Islamic morality. The imams themselves adopted the style of Middle East monarchies, becoming increasingly distant figures. As a result, they lost their charismatic and spiritual position among the tribes of Yemen. These recent developments made this the ideal moment to reassert our dominance over the highlands of Yemen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98642;The Kingdom of the Shilluk people declined over the years and now only their capital remains. They are backwards and would be easy prey and we already conquered much of their territory in the past. It’s time to end our conquest of their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98643;‘In the beginning, the first Senussi went to Mecca, where he joined Ahmad Ibn Idris al-Fasi, the head of the Khadirites. Due to Wahhabi pressure, Senussi left Mecca and settled in Cyrenaica in 1843, where in the mountains near Sidi Rafaa’ he built the Zawia Baida (White Monastery).’ The Senussi are a Muslim political-religious Sufi order and tribe in Cyrenaica. They claim a direct lineage to the Prophet Muhammad and are concerned with both the decline of Islamic thought and spirituality and the weakening of Muslim political integrity. The power of the current Grand Senussi, Sayyid Muhammad al-Mahdi bin Sayyid Muhammad as-Senussi, grew to the point that it made the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regime uneasy. In $YEAR$, he moved farther from direct $COUNTRY_ADJ$ surveillance to Jaghbub, where he has the authority of a sovereign in a vast but almost empty desert.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98645;The Mahdists in Sudan held Khartoum for months and their insurrection raged in Sudan. After our failure to put them down, they are declaring independence and forming a new fundamentalist state in Sudan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98646;The lack of formal authority in South Sudan, which was claimed by Egypt, was filled in the 1850s by a set of powerful merchant princes. In the east Muhammad Ahmad al-Aqqad controlled much land, but the most powerful was Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur who came to control the Bahr el Ghazal and other parts of South Sudan. Al-Zubayr was a merchant from Khartoum, who hired his own private army and marched south. He set up a network of trading forts known as zaribas through the region, and from these forts controlled local trade. To manage the trade al-Zubayr needed labour, and thus also began to capture a significant number of slaves. To his mercenary force he conscripted a large slave army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98647;The area known as the Bahr el Ghazal in South Sudan had long been the source of the goods that Darfur would trade to Egypt and North Africa, especially slaves and ivory. The natives of Bahr el Ghazal paid tribute to Darfur, and these were the chief articles of merchandise sold by the Furs to the Egyptian traders along the road to Asyut. Al-Zubayr redirected this flow of goods to Khartoum and the Nile with his conquest of South Sudan. Now, Sultan Ibrahim of Darfur insulted and challenged al-Zubayr who allied himself with his former enemies the Egyptians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98648;After the Egyptians withdrew from the Yemeni seaboard in 1841, Haj Ali Shermerki, a successful and ambitious Somali merchant, is offering to purchase executive rights over Zeila.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98649;For long, the seat of Metropolitan of Montenegro has been de facto a hereditary position. The Metropolitan would rule Montenegro, the small but de facto independent state surrounded by the Ottoman Empire. The last Metropolitan, Petar II Petrovic Njegos, before his death he named his nephew Danilo as his successor. When Njegos died, the Senate, under influence of Djordjije Petrovic, proclaimed Njegos’s elder brother Pero Tomov Petrovic as Prince and not Vladika. Nevertheless, in a brief struggle for power, Pero Tomov, who commanded the support of the Senate, lost to the much younger Danilo who had more support among the people. In $YEAR$ Danilo proclaimed the secular Principality of Montenegro with himself as Prince and formally abolished theocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98650;The call from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has come to $COUNTRY$, asking us to unify with their nation into a greater state-one which will forge a greater power in a new world order. There are those $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens who fear losing our identity in such a union, but many welcome the nation and rightly state that $FROMCOUNTRY$’s influence in $COUNTRY$ is already great. If we deny the union, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government may decide to enforce their claim on us whether we like it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98651;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ambassador has delivered a message: $FROMCOUNTRY$ will not join $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98655;After much discussion and deliberation, the Hungarians have agreed to expand the Austro-Hungarian union into a federation with the other Danubian cultures even if it means giving up some of their traditional claims to those lands. We may now proceed to propose the union to other local governments with full confidence that both our governments are behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98656;After much discussion and deliberation, the Hungarians have agreed to expand the Austro-Hungarian union into a federation with the other Danubian cultures… on one condition: that they be elevated to a fully autonomous state tied to the federation only in matters of foreign relations. We can ignore their proposal, but not without causing a great deal of discontent among the Hungarian people. Sadly, this appears to be as far as their government will go on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC98657;After much discussion and deliberation, the Hungarians have outright refused the proposed federation. They do not wish to lose their equal standing with the Austrian government, and see no benefit in surrendering claims to their traditional territories.

EVTDESC99000;Support the Qing! Destroy the Foreign!’ \n \n Many Chinese are growing enraged at the continuing encroachment of westerners into the Empire. They walk freely, spread Christianity with impunity, and ignore Imperial laws. A movement called the Righteous Harmony Society-known to foreigners as ‘Boxers’-has appeared, their mission to drive western influence out of the Qing Empire by any means necessary. Some are worried that attacks upon westerners could bring foreign anger down upon us, but there are those who see this as a good thing. Anger against westerners, even if it means a degree of chaos and disruption in our provinces, means support for the Qing government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99001;An attack upon a foreign merchant in $PROVINCENAME$ has signalled the arrival of the Boxer movement to $STATENAME$. Already the flags of the Righteous Harmony Society have been spotted, their followers recruiting fellow Chinese to support the Qing government in their struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99005;Throughout all of $STATENAME$, the Boxers are attacking western influence. Smugglers, missionaries, opium peddlers… anyone they can apprehend is being slain or forced to flee for their lives. We have a choice: either look the other way, risking anger from the great powers for these ‘atrocities’, or send in forces to suppress the Boxers and risk the anger of our own people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99006;A group of Chinese nationalists known as the ‘Boxers’, intent on driving all western influence out of $FROMCOUNTRY$, have attacked a group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. Several were slain, while others were forced to flee for their lives. Worse, the Qing government has done nothing about it. They are looking the other way while these atrocities are being committed upon our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99010;The Boxers have reached the capital of $COUNTRY$, streaming into $CAPITAL$ to attack foreigners-and, far more noteworthy, they have laid siege to the Legation Quarter. Hundreds of foreign dignitaries and merchants reside within. If we do not step in to protect them, it will be seen as a declaration of support for the Boxers and an act of war against the great powers. If we do, the Boxers will see it as a betrayal of their cause and perhaps even rise up in rebellion against us. They have forced our hand now, however, and we have no choice but to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99011;The Boxer situation in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has reached a head: the Chinese nationalists have entered Peking, laying siege to the Legation Quarter and putting the lives of dozens of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ merchants and dignitaries at risk. The Qing government has looked the other way, an act that is seen by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as a declaration of war. Many are calling upon us to intervene in order to protect $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens from these barbarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99015;We are forced to submit to the foreign demands, signing a treaty with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ generals and representatives from all the great powers. The Righteous Harmony Society will be forcibly disbanded, its leaders executed or imprisoned, and our government is once again humiliated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99100;You must desist from all correspondence with Russia. You must never receive agents from them, or have ought to do with them without our sanction, you must dismiss Captain Viktevitch with courtesy, you must surrender all claims to Peshawar\n \n The Governor-General of India, Lord Auckland, has ordered an expedition to Afghanistan to depose Dost Mohammed and put Shuja Shah back on the Afghan throne in order to place the emirate into the British sphere of influence in order to deter Russian influence in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99101;At the beginning of the Anglo-Afghan War, the British restored Shah Shujah Durrani as emir. However an uprising in Kabul forced Sir William Elphinstone to withdraw the garrison. \n \n He negotiated an agreement with Wazir Akbar Khan, by which his army was to fall back to Jalalabad, more than 90 miles away. However the Afghans launched numerous attacks against the column as it made slow progress through the Hindu Kush. In total the British lost 4,500 troops, along with about 12,000 civilians: the latter comprising both the families of Indian and British soldiers, plus other Indian camp-followers. \n \n Out of more than 16,000 people from the column commanded by Elphinstone, only one European (Assistant Surgeon William Brydon) and a few Indian sepoys reached Jalalabad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99102;After the Anglo-Sikh war, the city of Multan was governed by Dewan Mulraj, who behaved independently and often resisted British authority. When he was required by the British to pay an increased tax assessment and revenues which were in arrears, Mulraj attempted to give up power to his son, so as to maintain his family’s position as rulers. Instead he was to be replaced by, Sardar Kahan Singh, along with a British liaison, Lieutenant Patrick Vans Agnew. \n \n When Vans Agnew’s Party arrived in Multan, Mulraj handed over the keys of the fortress, but as they attempted to take possession, they were attacked by Mulraj’s troops and murdered by a city mob. \n \n In a short time the Sikh troops and sardars in the city had joined in open rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99103;The British ambassador has come to us with an interesting proposal-to establish a neutral ground over Afghanistan to ease tensions between $COUNTRY$ and $FROMCOUNTRY$ in Central Asia, Afghanistan would be placed under the British sphere of influence, while in return the British would recognize all our conquests in Central Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99105;Following a peace mission sent to Bhutan in early $YEAR$, in the wake of the recent conclusion of a civil war there, under Ashley Eden. The dzongpon of Punakha—who had emerged victorious—had broken with the central government and set up a rival Druk Desi while the legitimate druk desi sought the protection of the penlop of Paro and was later deposed. \n \n The British mission dealt alternately with the rival penlop of Paro and the penlop of Trongsa (the latter acted on behalf of the druk desi), but Bhutan rejected the peace and friendship treaty it offered. \n \n Britain soon declared war. Bhutan had no regular army, and what forces existed were composed of dzong guards armed with matchlocks, bows and arrows, swords, knives, and catapults. Some of these dzong guards, carrying shields and wearing chainmail armour, engaged the well-equipped British forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99106;Throughout the 19th century, Britain attempted to gain a foothold in Manipur state affairs. Political instability, culminated in the aftermath of Maharajah Chandrakirti’s death. In $YEAR$, prince Kulachandra Singh led a revolt against reigning Maharaja Surchandra dethroning him. Surchandra filed a complaint to Viceroy of India Lord Landsdowne, who in turn dispatched 400 Gurkhas under the command of J.W. Quinton, aiming at arresting the conspirators.\n \n British troops launched a raid on the Kangla Palace but were captured Manipuri troops. Quinton then held talks with Kulachandra, expressing his intent at ceasing all hostilities and returning to Kohima. However, he perceived Quinton’s assertions as an act of deception, and he was detained and beheaded along with four other British officers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99107;A region in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ East Africa has been described by some as ‘The White Highlands’, it is an area in the central uplands of Kenya, so-called because, Europeans settled there in considerable numbers. They were attracted to the good soils and growing conditions, as well as the cool climate. \n \n The native Maasai, who are pastoralists, found the amount of grazing land considerably reduced as the White Highlands expanded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99200;News has come to us about a large Persian force, led by the Shah of Persia Mohammed Shah Qajar. with Russian advisors has besieged the Afghan city of Herat. With the help of one of our subjects, Eldred Pottinger a diplomat and an officer of the Bengal Artillery, the Afghans have managed to hold the city thus far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99201;The British have chosen to intervene in our expedition to Herat-A British envoy, Charles Stoddart has delivered to us an ultimatum to withdraw from Herat and abandon all claims in the region, the British have also dispatched a naval expedition to occupy Kharg Island, threatening further actions if their demands are not met.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99203;The Persians have agreed to our demands have and withdrawn their forces from Herat and the Russian advisors supporting the siege have been recalled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99204;The Treaty of Paris ($YEAR$) marked the end of the hostilities of the Anglo-Persian War. On the Persian side negotiations were handled by ambassador Ferukh Khan. In the Treaty, the Persians agreed to withdraw from Herat, to apologise to the British ambassador on his return, and to sign a commercial treaty;the British agreed not to shelter opponents of the Shah in the embassy, and they abandoned the demand to replace prime minister as well as one requiring territorial concessions to the Imam of Muscat, a British ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99700;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have come to us with a proposal to recognise $COUNTRY_ADJ$ sovereignty over the region of the Mosquito Coast, but will reserve, on the basis of historical rights, a self-governing enclave for the Miskito, an indigenous group in the area. The provisions of the treaty would be:\n \n 1. Sovereignty over the Mosquito Coast belongs to $COUNTRY$, but the autonomy of the Miskito is guaranteed.\n 2. $COUNTRY$ has the right to fly its flag in any part of the Mosquito Coast.\n 3. $COUNTRY$ would maintain a Commissioner on the Mosquito Coast to defend her national interests.\n 4. $COUNTRY$ would not make concessions to the exploitation of natural resources in the Mosquito Coast. That right alone corresponded to the Miskito government.\n 5. $COUNTRY$ cannot regulate Miskito’s trade tax, nor its importations nor exportations.\n 6. $COUNTRY$ would pay a compensation to the Miskito king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99800;In 1845, seven cantons-Lucerne, Fribourg, Valais, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden and Zug, all predominantly Catholic and governed by Conservative administrations formed the Sonderbund (‘separate alliance’). The cantons of Ticino and Solothurn, also predominantly Catholic but governed by liberal administrations, did not join the alliance. \n \n The Sonderbund was in violation of the Federal Treaty of 1815, Section 6 of which expressly forbade such separate alliances, and the liberal majority in the Tagsatzung decided to dissolve the Sonderbund on October 21, 1847. The confederate army was raised against the members of the Sonderbund. The army was composed of soldiers of all the other cantons except Neuchatel and Appenzell Innerrhoden (which remained neutral).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Meanwhile, farming improvements in Southern Europe and the Russian Empire created surplus labour. This wave of migration, constituting the third episode in the history of U.S. immigration, may be better referred to as a flood of immigrants, as nearly 25 million Europeans made the long trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99809;Following disaster at the initial invasion, British forces in Zululand were scattered. At Rorke’s Drift, a field supply depot and hospital, a small force under Lt. Gonville Bromhead received news of a large Zulu force approaching. Noting that a small column, travelling in open country and burdened with carts of the wounded, would be easily overran by a numerically superior Zulu force, the only choice was to remain and fight.\n \n In the end, just over 150 British and colonial troops successfully defended the garrison against an assault by 4,000 Zulus. The massive but piecemeal Zulu attacks on Rorke’s Drift came very close to defeating the much smaller garrison, but were ultimately repelled. Eleven Victoria Crosses were awarded to the defenders, along with a number of other decorations and honours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99820;The Ottoman Empire has been in slow decline for much of the last century, but never has this been more apparent than in recent years. The Empire’s hold on the Balkans is weakening, and this threatens to upset the entire balance of power in Eastern Europe as Russia and other countries will inevitably be drawn into the conflict. Many in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government feel that it falls on $COUNTRY$ to protect the Christians in the East, and restore some semblance of stability to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99821;We have received word from the Russians that they intend to hold a conference of European powers in Constantinople to discuss the ability of the Ottoman Empire to maintain stability in the Balkans.

EVTDESC99824;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has declared their unconditional support for the Ottoman Empire, claiming their reasoning is to ‘Keep Russian Expansionism in check’. We must now decide whether to carry on with our war preparations, or back down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99825;The Ottoman Empire, represented by Grand Vizier Midhat Pasha announced the definitive refusal of the Ottoman Empire to accept the agreements made in the Constantinople Conference. With all of the Great Powers in Europe having agreed to remain neutral in the conflict and high anti-Ottoman sympathies throughout Europe, the time has come to declare war on the Ottoman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99900;The Free Port of Singapore. Due to its strategic position in the Straits of Johore, Singapore grew to become one of the most important ports in the world. In 1834, the British government ended the East India Company’s monopoly on the China trade, allowing other British companies to enter the market and leading to a surge in shipping, as a result Singapore became an important coaling station for steam shipping networks that were beginning to form in the 1840s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99901;Poverty in China due to the Opium Wars sparked many Chinese to seek better lives in Singapore, ‘These Chinese coolies formed the early backbone of Singapore’s labour force, engaged mainly in hard physical labour. Their cheap labour in Singapore’s mines, ports, construction sites, plantations and jungles contributed greatly to the island’s growth. The word ‘coolie’ is believed to have come from the Hindi term kuli, which is also the name of a native tribe of Gujarat in western India.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99902;Between 1793 and 1850 nearly 200,000 free settlers and assisted immigrants chose to migrate to Australia to start a new life. The majority were English agricultural workers or domestic servants who outnumbered the Irish and Scottish migrants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99903;The California Gold Rush began on $YEAR$, when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter’s Mill in Coloma, California. The first to hear confirmed information of the gold rush were the people in Oregon, the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), and Latin America, and they were the first to start flocking to the state in late $YEAR$. \n \n All in all, the news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad. Of the 300,000, approximately half arrived by sea and half came overland on the California Trail and the Gila River trail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99905;An uprising of several hundred revolutionaries, funded by revolutionaries living in Malaya attempted an uprising in the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. Although initially successful, Qing reinforcements quickly turned the battle into a catastrophic defeat for the revolutionaries, killing most of them. Revolutionary leader Huang Xing was wounded during the battle-he lost one of his fingers when it was hit by a bullet. \n \n The dead were mostly youths with all kinds of social backgrounds, former students, teachers, journalists, and oversea Chinese. Some of them were of high rank in the Alliance. Before the battle, most of the revolutionaries knew that the battle would probably be lost, since they were heavily outnumbered, but they went into battle anyway. The mission was carried out like that of a suicide squad. Their letters to their loved ones were later found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99906;On his return to Germany from his 1879-1882 Pacific expedition, Otto Finsch joined a small, informal group interested in German colonial expansion into the South Seas led by the banker, Adolph von Hansemann.

EVTDESC99907;It is with much grief that I feel myself obliged to communicate to your Excellency a dreadful event which has happened to me, and as an English subject to beg your protection. Last Sunday, Easter-day, at about 12 o’clock, a crowd of people, presented themselves at the door of my house, which they very soon battered down. These brigands, in number about 300 or 400, entered my house, and began beating my wife and my innocent children. After having broken every article of furniture, they robbed me of every valuable in my possession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99908;Apparently, the former Portuguese Consul Don Pacifico was attacked by a mob in his home and in an act of pure arrogance, the British have demanded a compensation be paid to this man, of which the valuation of his losses are worth more than the Royal Place in Athens! Our pride dictates that we cannot give in to these absurd claims, but to not do so might incur the wrath of the mighty Royal Navy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99909;I have desired the Admiralty to instruct Sir William Parker to take Athens on his way back from the Dardanelles, and to support you in bringing at last to a satisfactory ending the settlement of our various claims upon the Greek Government. If however, the Greek Government does not strike, Parker must do so. In that case you should embark on board his fleet before he begins to take any hostile steps, in order that you and your mission may be secure against insult. He should, of course, begin by reprisals, that is, by taking possession of some Greek property, but the King would probably not much care for our taking hold of any merchant property, and the best thing, therefore, would be to seize hold of his little fleet, if that can be done handily. The next thing would be a blockade of any or all of his ports….-Lord Palmerston, Foreign Secretary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99910;The Greek Government has agreed to pay full compensation to both Don Pacifico and the Portuguese government for their losses. Although the other great powers disapprove of our heavy-handed methods of diplomacy, any British subject, in whatever land he may be, shall feel confident that the watchful eye and the strong arm of England will protect him from injustice and wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99911;A British fleet has appeared off our shores and has seized several of our warships, this is an act of humiliation to the Greek people! The French and the Prussians are calling for us to resist the British Blockade, but have not guaranteed any military support.

EVTDESC99912;The Guangxu Emperor was the eleventh emperor of the Qing dynasty, and the ninth Qing emperor to rule over China, during much of his rule, was constantly hampered by Empress Dowager Cixi’s strong influence over the conservatives in the Qing Court. His regnal name, ‘Guangxu’, means ‘glorious succession’. \n Throughout his reign, the Guangxu Emperor came to believe that by learning from constitutional monarchies like Japan, the Qing Empire would become more politically and economically powerful. However, opposition from traditionalist factions in China would severely hamper any attempts at real reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99920;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has requested military aid from us in their conflict, while the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s are not expecting us to intervene directly in their conflict, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ indirect military aid to them might be in both our interests. If we were to send help to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s, Military advisors, arms and other supplies can be shipped out immediately, and we can always make the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government pay up after the war’s over whether they are successful or not. The catch, of course, is that this could potentially escalate and drag us into the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99921;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has come to our aid! Although it’s not a direct intervention on our side, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ officers, arms and supplies are now available to us. Hopefully, this will bring us victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99928;In the 1850s, the cities of each colony began a period of dramatic change. This transformation was due to an increased population, wealth from the gold rushes in New South Wales and Victoria and new ideas generated by a culturally diverse population. By the end of the decade, public structures and housing in Sydney and Melbourne had multiplied. Many elegant and ornate civic buildings with attractive tree-lined and paved streetscapes were built. \n \n Between 1851 and 1854, the population of Victoria grew from about 77,000 to more than 200,000.

During the late 19th century, Britain’s primary goal in foreign policy was to maintain the balance of power in Europe and to intervene if that balance was upset. Its secondary goal was to protect its overseas interest in the colonies and dominions, as free trade kept the Empire alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99935;In $YEAR$, Congress narrowly passed a bill that authorized the U.S. to annex the Republic of Texas if it so voted. The legislation set the date for annexation for the end of the same year. A majority of voters in Texas approved a proposed constitution that specifically endorsed slavery and the slave trade. This constitution was later accepted by the U.S. Congress, making Texas a state on the same day annexation took effect, therefore bypassing a territorial phase \n \n The Mexican government had long warned that annexation would mean war with the U.S. When Texas joined the U.S., the Mexican government broke diplomatic relations with the United States. The U.S. now assumed the claims of Texas when it claimed all land north of the Rio Grande. In $YEAR$ President James K.

EVTDESC99936;In the mid-to-late 19th century, the Chinese Qing Empire weakened substantially and became increasingly unable to support the Lanfang Republic as its vassal state. Thus, Lanfang Republic’s vigorous development suffered from the eventual expansion of the Dutch. The Republic’s citizenry waged a tenacious resistance, but ultimately failed due to poor weaponry. Many of Lanfang’s citizens and their descendants made their way to Sumatra or Singapore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99937;Georges Ernest Jean-Marie Boulanger, nicknamed General Revanche, was a French officer who was noted for his bravery and leadership during the Franco-Prussian War and was among the leaders of the Third Republic who crushed the short-lived Paris Commune. \n \n With backing from his direct superior, Henri d’Orleans, duc d’Aumale (incidentally, one of the sons of former king Louis-Philippe), Boulanger was made a brigadier-general and in $YEAR$ was appointed director of infantry at the war office. His base of support and popularity comes from the working districts of Paris and other cities, plus rural traditionalist Catholics and royalists, however he was initially seen as a Republican. He is noted for an aggressive form of nationalism, known as Revanchism, which opposes The German Empire and calls for the defeat of the Franco-Prussian War to be avenged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99938;After Georges Boulanger was recalled from the command of the army in North Africa, he returned to Paris, and began to take part in politics under the aegis of Georges Clemenceau and the Radicals. \n \n In $YEAR$, when Charles de Freycinet was brought into power, Clemenceau used his influence to secure Boulanger’s appointment as War Minister. Clemenceau assumed Boulanger was a republican, because he was known not to attend Mass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99939;In $YEAR$, the French Havas news agency published a dispatch to the effect that Guillaume Schnaebele, a mid-level and obscure French police inspector, had been arrested by two agents of the German secret police on the Franco-German frontier near Pagny-sur-Moselle, as he was travelling for a meeting with the German police inspector there, at the latter’s request. A dispute followed as to whether the arrest had taken place on French or on German territory, but regardless, under the circumstances Schnaebele is entitled to immunity even if on German territory, since he had been invited to a conference by German officials. \n \n The reason given for the arrest was that in a previous inquiry, evidence had been produced that Schnaebele was involved in transmitting information as to German fortresses, furnished by Alsatians in the pay of the French Government, in other words, the Germans believe Schnaebelé to be a spy. \n \n What should the response of the French Government be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99940;In $YEAR$, the French Havas news agency published a dispatch to the effect that Guillaume Schnaebele, a mid-level and obscure French police inspector, had been arrested by two agents of the German secret police on the Franco-German frontier near Pagny-sur-Moselle, as he was on his way to Ars-sur-Moselle for a meeting with the German police inspector there, at the latter’s request. A dispute followed as to whether the arrest had taken place on French or on German territory, but regardless, the French claim Schnaebele is entitled to immunity even if on German territory, since he had been invited to a conference by German officials. \n \n It is suspected by German officials that Schnaebelé had been spying on German border fortresses for the French Government, however the circumstances behind his arrest may put us in a negative light despite of the proofs of guilt. \n \n What should our response to the French be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99941;Within a week of his arrest, Schnaebelé was released by order of the German Emperor William I. Although the German Government considered, in view of the proofs of guilt, the arrest to be fully justified, it was deemed expedient to release Schnaebelé on the ground that business meetings between frontier officials ‘must always be regarded as protected by a mutually-assured safe conduct.’ \n \n Although many in France believe Bismarck backed down because he was afraid of Boulanger, the French Army is no better off than it was during the Franco-Prussian War. \n \n There is now question on what to do with Boulanger, with many within the government to have him sacked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99942;Daniel Wilson, son-in-law of the sitting President Jules Grevy, has been caught selling Legion d’honneur medals for his own personal gain public outcry for his arrest and for Jules Grevy to resign. \n \n During this period, General Boulanger was in Switzerland, where he met with Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte II, technically a Bonapartist, who offered his full support to the cause. The Bonapartists had attached themselves to the general, and even the Comte de Paris encouraged his followers to support him. Once seen as a republican, Boulanger shows his true colours in the camp of the conservative monarchists. In $MONTH$, $YEAR$ Boulanger was expelled from the army and the day after, Daniel Wilson had his imprisonment repealed. It seemed to the French people that honourable generals were punished while corrupt politicians were spared, further increasing Boulanger’s popularity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99943;In the elections of $YEAR$, Boulanger ran as a deputy for Paris, and, after an intense campaign, took the seat with 244,000 votes against the 160,000 of his main adversary. A coup d’état seems probable and desirable among his supporters. How should the next few days proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99944;Had Boulanger immediately placed himself at the head of a revolt he might have affected the coup which many of his partisans had worked for, and might even have governed France, but the opportunity passed with his procrastination on $MONTH$. According to Lady Randolph Churchill ‘all his thoughts were centred in and controlled by her who was the mainspring of his life. After the plebiscite…he rushed off to Madame Bonnemain’s house and could not be found’. \n \n Boulanger decided that it would be better to contest the general election and take power legally. This gave his enemies the time they needed to strike back, and activities of secret societies were soon forbidden and banned.\n \n Shortly afterward the government issued a warrant for Boulanger’s arrest for conspiracy and treasonable activity. To the astonishment of his supporters, he fled Paris before it could be executed, going first to Brussels and then to London.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99945;Acting quickly, Georges Boulanger and his supporters have launched a coup in Paris, seizing control of the country and dissolving the Third Republic. Now the question is whether to install Boulanger as President for Life of the Fourth Republic or to Restore the French Monarchy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99946;We have received a formal request from the Qing Government for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military intervention against the Taiping Rebellion, which has wreaked havoc throughout China. In the aftermath of the Second Opium War, although the Treaty of Peking have given us very favourable terms, those terms are of little use if the Qing government collapses. \n \n Furthermore, there have also been reports that the rebels are threatening our treaty ports and legations. We must act with haste to put an end to the rebellion and restore order to China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99947;In the southern province of Guizhou, The Miaotze, having taken advantage of the Panthay rebellion in neighbouring Yunnan and the Taiping rebellion, have risen up in revolt against Han Chinese rule. The Qing Government must swiftly deal with this insurrection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99948;With $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces marching into Guiyang, the Miao Rebellion is officially over. The Miaotze rebels and their leaders have been crushed. Many of the Miao people have been slaughtered by our forces, and their fighting spirit has been crushed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99949;The Battle of Cau Giay or Paper Bridge, one of the numerous clashes of the French expedition to Tonkin against Liu Yongfu’s Black Flag Army has resulted in defeat. A small force under the command of capitaine de vaisseau Henri Riviere attacked a strong Black Flag defensive position near the village of Cau Giay a few miles to the west of Hanoi, aslo known as Paper Bridge (Pont de Papier). \n \n After initial successes, the expedition forces were eventually enveloped on both wings, and were only with difficulty able to regroup and fall back to Hanoi. Riviere and several other senior officers were killed in the action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99950;Opposition to the reforms implemented by the Guangxu Emperor and his reformers was intense among the conservative ruling elite, who, condemning the announced reform as too radical, proposed instead a more moderate and gradualist course of change. \n \n With the tacit support of the political opportunist Yuan Shikai and the backing of conservatives, Empress Dowager Cixi engineered a coup d’état on $MONTH$, $YEAR$, forcing the young, reform-minded Guangxu into seclusion. The emperor has been put under house arrest within the Summer Palace. Cixi shall take over the Imperial government as regent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99951;The Qing Empire is currently attempting to modernize it’s military with the establishment of a modern ocean-going battlefleet and has placed an order of several warships. \n \n Taking this order would certainly prove the capability of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ naval construction to other powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99952;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has accepted the payment for the ships to be constructed for the Beiyang Fleet and have begun construction on the warships. We will have to wait some time before the ships are ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99953;"The ships of the Beiyang Fleet have been completed and delivered to our Navy; this is a glorious day for the Qing Empire!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99956;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has declared war in an attempt to restore the deposed Republican government. This will be a fight to the death for our socialist revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99957;The balance of power in Europe has been upset, remaining isolationist will no longer beneficial to Great Britain and her empire. We must quickly search for an alliance with other great powers and restore the balance of power in the continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99958;Now that the war is over and the Southern provinces are now once again under Dutch rule, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s have been quick to pressure us to follow our obligations. Under the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg will be ruled under personal union with the Kingdom of the Netherlands under the House of Orange-Nassau, and shall join the German Customs Union. \n \n Should we defy the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s, we would risk a second war…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99961;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s are offering that in return for $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ military assistance in the successful restoration of control in the Southern provinces, that Luxembourg shall be granted autonomy and shall join the German Customs Union (Zollverein), ruled under personal union with the Kingdom of the Netherlands by the House of Orange-Nassau. \n \n My King, should we accept their offer? \n \n §R(NOTE: You will have to declare war against Belgium again if you refuse.);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99962;We are forced to submit to the foreign demands, signing a treaty with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats, our armies lay scattered and destroyed and whatever territory the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ controlled has been returned to the Manchu. This is a devastating blow to our Heavenly Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99963;"Western forces have been immensely successful in their fight against the Taiping rebels; however it is up to our own armies to end this devastating war. Nanjing will fall!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99964;Kill the Rich and Aid the Poor!’\n \n After the Yellow River floods, widespread devastation across the Northern Anhui and Henan regions. Due to the recent war with the British and the ongoing fighting against the Taiping Rebellion, aid to the region was minimal and ineffective. This enraged the Nian movement, which blamed the Europeans for contributing to China’s troubles, and increasingly viewed the Qing government as incompetent and cowardly in the face of the Western powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99965;In $YEAR$, after the Yellow River had burst once again, ineffective government aid drove many of the displaced people to join the Nian Militias. Seizing the opportunity, Zhang Lexing, the leader of the Nian movement, took direct action by launching attacks against government troops in central China. \n \n Another rebellion in China had begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99966;The Nian used the ‘Five Element Banner Army system’, based on the earlier White Lotus uprisings, the banners were coloured Green, Red, Black, White & Yellow. \n \n Qing forces were badly overstretched due to other rebellions across China, allowing the Nian armies to conquer large tracts of land and gain control over economically vital areas. The Nian fortified their captured cities and used them as bases to launch cavalry attacks against Qing troops in the countryside, prompting local towns to fortify themselves against Nian raiding parties. \n \n In $MONTH$, $YEAR$, the Qing government sent the Mongol General Senggelinqin, who had recently crushed a large Taiping army, to defeat the Nian.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99967;By $YEAR$, the leader of the Nian rebellion, Zhang Lexing and many of his commanders, including his younger brother have been killed or captured. Qing imperial troops had recaptured most Nian territory, the remnants of the Nian were crushed by the combined forces of the government’s troops and the Ever-Victorious Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99968;By $YEAR$, despite the best efforts of our navy and army to restore Qing control of China, the rebels of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom have finally stormed Peking and have deposed the Manchu Emperor and our efforts in the far east are now for naught. There is debate of what course of action we should now take-although the restoration of the Qing Empire is now out of the question, new opportunities may arise over the weakened new Chinese state. \n \n Firstly, there are still several former breakaway states from the Qing Empire that are still independent of Taiping rule which are ripe for British influence and exploitation. Secondly, several coastal cities of China are still under our influence and control, and under the past treaties with the Qing, these ports have to remain open to foreign trade. \n \n Now the question is which course should we take-Extending our influence to the breakaway Chinese states, Seizing the coastal ports open to foreign trade, or make peace with the new Chinese Kingdom?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99969;With the fall of the Qing Empire, our new nation is now finally free from Manchu rule. However, the freedom we fought so hard for from the Manchu may be once again be threaten by Taiping rule in China. British diplomats have proposed that we sign a treaty of friendship and allow British advisors in our courts and give British subjects extraterritoriality. Should we side with the British to maintain our independence, or should we reunite with China?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99970;The cowardly $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have seized the ports of Canton and Ningbo, claiming that the treaties with the now defunct Qing Empire are still valid, and have taken control of these cities to ensure foreign traders can still flock into China. We should act against in retaliation and seize all $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ holdings in our lands, however our armies have been devasted in the fight against the Manchu, and another costly war may be undesirable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99971;Following the crushing defeat by the French and the Treaty of New York, our great nation has been essentially cut in two, effective centralization and governance of the Western states and territories is all but impossible. \n \n The states of California and Texas have demanded that they be granted autonomy to run their own affairs until we are one day able to reclaim our lost lands, for now we have little choice but to agree to their demands. \n \n The only positive outcome is that the Anglo-Canadians of have petitioned for join the Union as the state of Ontario, we will certainly need their help in reclaiming our destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99972;The British government has approached us with an interesting proposal, in light of the collapse of the Ottoman Dynasty, Turkish ability to hold to the Arab provinces is severely weakened. The British have proposed that the Arab provinces be split into two spheres of influence-France will control of south-eastern Turkey, northern Iraq, Syria and Lebanon while Britain would be allocated control of the areas roughly comprising the coastal strip between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan, Jordan, southern Iraq, and an additional small area that included the ports of Haifa and Acre, to allow access to the Mediterranean. \n \n If we were to agree to this proposal, we would quickly find ourselves at war with the Turks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99973;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Government has agreed to the proposal, our troops will be mobilized and deployed to the Orient at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99974;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Government has rejected our proposal and refuse to participate in the partitioning of Turkey, what course of action should we take now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99975;There has been a plot by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ to partition our nation by seizing the Arab province, and reports of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ warships and troops leaving port and setting sail towards the Orient. What course of action should we take?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99976;Like vultures the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have descended upon us. We have been forced to the bargaining table to accept humiliating terms of the Treaty of Sevres regarding the breakup and partitioning of our great nation. This is a moment that shall be remembered in $COUNTRY$ for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99977;Enabling this feature will allow the AI get (most of) their historical Colonies. The following Colonies are affected: \n \n France-West & Central Africa\n \n Germany-Kamerun, East Africa, New Guinea, Togoland. \n \n NOTE: For West Africa, France doesn’t automatically annex their colonies, they will simply immediately declare war on them once the Berlin Conference fires, so you still can try to steal it from them if you’re fast enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99978;The territories of the Left Bank of the Rhine, which French troops had conquered in 1795, had been returned to German (mostly Prussian) control after the 1815 Congress of Vienna, forming the Rhine Province. On $YEAR$, France shifted its focus to the Rhine, and the French government, led by Adolphe Thiers, restated its claim to the areas on the left bank, to re-establish the Rhine as a natural border. \n \n The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has called for German unity against a second French threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99979;"During the Austro-Prussian War Brother’s War, Napoleon III promised the Prussian Prime Minister, Otto von Bismarck, of France’s neutrality, hoping that such an open statement of intent would strengthen France’s negotiating position regarding the western bank of the Rhine. Bismarck refused to offer any land from the Rhineland, which was Napoleon’s preferred region. However, he did make suggestions of French hegemony in Belgium and Luxembourg, although not committing anything to writing. \n \n Napoleon III has offered the Netherlands 5,000,000 guilders for Luxembourg. Being in deep financial trouble, the Netherlands accepted the offer. News of this purchase has caused nationalist fervour and public outcry across Germany; we must decide what position $COUNTRY$ stands on the purchase.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99980;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has objected to the sale of Luxembourg to $COUNTRY$, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has threatened war if the sale were still to go through. However, they are willing to come to an acceptable compromise that leaves Luxembourg a part of neither country, leaving us with a possible face-saving outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99981;Although public outcry throughout much of Germany objected our actions, the government of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has not objected to the purchase of Luxembourg, the sale will go through and the territory will be incorporated into France immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99982;With the German public angered and an impasse developing, Napoleon III sought to backtrack-he certainly did not want to appear to be unduly expansionist to the other Great Powers. Thus, he demanded only that Prussia withdraw its soldiers from Luxembourg City, threatening war in the event that Prussia did not comply. Tsar Alexander II of Russia called for an international conference, to be held in London. The United Kingdom was more than happy to host the talks as the British government feared that the absorption of Luxembourg by either power would weaken Belgium, a useful buffer between Germany and France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99983;Despite our objections and attempts at meditation for a peaceful outcome, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has pushed through the sale and has annexed Luxembourg regardless of the will of the international community. This leaves us without a choice but to go to war to liberate the people of Luxembourg from French rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99984;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has proclaimed that the region of Wallonia is a rightful part of France and has stated its intention to seize the region by force if necessary, we must either look to the great powers to defend us from a French invasion, or we could surrender the region to avoid a costly war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99985;France has proclaimed that the region of Wallonia is a rightful part of France and has stated its intention to seize the region by force if necessary, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has requested that we intervene and form an alliance in the event of a French invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99986;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has request aid for the other Great Powers of Europe, the two best courses of action is to swiftly strike the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ before the other European powers are ready to support them, or two back down and give up our claims to the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99987;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has backed down, and have renounced their claims on the region of Wallonia, the Walloon Crisis has ended in our favour, and another European war has been averted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99988;With the victory of the Carlists and the crowning of Carlos V as King of Spain. Once of his first declarations is that he intends to return ‘rightful’ Spanish rule to its former colonies once more. This is a concerning development, we should be prepared to fight for our freedoms once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99989;Many of our citizens have begun to blame our nations woes and failures on internal sabotage by the Jewish people, their shops have been attacked, their places of worship burn, many are calling for our government to revoke the citizenship of the Jewish people in our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99990;The affair ended with the new Emperor kneeling before his old Emperor and Lord, that is to say, me, and asking for a blessing, which I gave him, laying both hands on his head and making the sign of the Holy Cross … then I embraced him and kissed our new master, and then we went to our room. Afterwards I and my dear wife heard Holy Mass … After that I and my dear wife packed our bags. \n \n The Emperor, Ferdinand I has been convinced by Felix zu Schwarzenberg to abdicate in favour of his nephew, Franz Joseph in response to the ongoing revolutions of $YEAR$, he would spend the rest of his days in Prague Castle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99991;In $YEAR$, A fine was imposed on the Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation for under-reporting its extractions of teak from Toungoo and not paying its employees. The company was fined by a Burmese court, and some of its timber was seized by the Burmese officials. The company and the British government claimed the charges were false and the Burmese courts were corrupt. The British demanded the Burmese government accept a British-appointed arbitrator to settle the dispute. When the Burmese refused, the British issued an ultimatum, which would have been impossible for the Burmese to accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99992;Taking advantage in the chaos of the revolution, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have occupied French Lands in the West Indies, and have formed a West Indies Confederation answering to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99993;Our efforts in claiming the rhine as our natural border have failed, and we have been forced to renounce any claims on the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99994;The Left Bank of the Rhine is now firmly under French control, our natural border to the west is secured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99995;Under the terms of the Treaty of Berlin, we have been forced to secede territories on the left bank on the Rhein to the new French puppet state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99997;The dynamic development of Chian shipping in the 19th century is further attested by the various shipping related services that were present in the island during this time, such as the creation of the shipping insurance companies Chiaki Thalssoploia, Dyo Adelfai, Omonoia, the shipping bank Archangelos. The boom of Chian shipping took place with the successful transition from sailing vessels to steam. \n \n To this end, Chian ship owners were supported by the strong diaspora presence of Chian merchants, the connections they had developed with the financing centres of the time (Istanbul, London), the establishment in London of shipping businessmen, the creation of shipping academies in Chios and the expertise of Chian personnel on board.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC99998;Throughout the long period of Ottoman domination of the Balkans, many Turkish Muslims overtime had settled in our lands and have held a privileged position over the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.

EVTOPTA95262;The Founding Fathers would be proud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95266;An outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA95520;How the mighty have fallen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95521;Damn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95610;It remains a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95612;This is not good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95613;Use the excuse to attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95614;That is a relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95615;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95616;Assume control of $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95639;This does not bode well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95640;Demand Cochin China, or it is war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95641;Turn over Cochin China. There is nothing we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95642;Then war it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95645;Ask for Foreign protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA95652;We have no choice. Surrender the territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95653;A foolish move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95654;A wise move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95655;Give them what they want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA95656;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA96216;A greater destiny awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97000;This will come to nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97001;That is not going to happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97002;I told you it would come to nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97003;There may be trouble ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA97156;They’ve been taught their lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97160;We do not want to get involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97161;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97165;No. We will stand on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97166;$FROMCOUNTRY$ is on its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA97175;This cannot be allowed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97180;We will assume control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97181;We’ll be back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97185;About time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97500;Russia protects the Holy Land, not France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97501;Pressure them into accepting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97502;We must give in to the French.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97503;We are the protectors of Eastern Christians, not the French.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97504;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97505;This will surely lead to trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97506;We intend to stay out of the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97507;A dark day for the Ottoman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97508;We accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97509;A great relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97510;Give them Izmail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97511;It’s about time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97512;There shall be a reckoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97515;We shall declare our independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97516;We will assist the Romanians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97520;Give them Izmail, as promised.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97521;A dark day for Romania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97525;How dare they!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97526;They want war? We’ll give them war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97530;The Romanian people will be free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97531;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ suzerainty must be re-established!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA97556;Excellent news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97560;We will fight to preserve the republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97562;We have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97566;We will do what we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97570;They are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, not ‘foreigners’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97600;This is the proper way for Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97601;To resist the westerners, we must learn their ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97605;We have little choice but to agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97606;Well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA97608;It seems we have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97609;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97610;An unfortunate choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97615;Japan must not descend into anarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97616;This disruption is growing worse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97617;A dangerous and reckless act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97618;$COUNTRY$ supports the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97620;We will support the tozama and make Yoshinobu shogun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97623;We shall see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97624;A good sign indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97625;A compromise is clearly required.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97627;This is most unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97630;We welcome the new emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97635;We will seek allies among the southern tozama.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97636;Perhaps it is time for a change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97637;Perhaps it is time for a change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97640;We shall support the Emperor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97641;The Emperor steps beyond his place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97642;Then fight we shall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97645;The Boshin War is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97646;A victory for all of Japan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97647;Of course, we will comply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97648;We will move the capital to Edo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97650;The Boshin War is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA97652;Of course, we will comply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97660;Support the Taisho Democracy movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97661;Then change we must.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97665;This cannot be allowed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97666;Then it is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97670;We must claim the northern islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97673;So it shall be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97674;So it shall be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97675;We should take advantage while we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97676;We shall resist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97677;We should take advantage while we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97678;Demand the island, or it is war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97679;We cannot fight them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97680;Demand the island, or it is war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97681;The islands aren’t worth a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97682;Unfortunately, this cannot be allowed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97683;A worrying development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97684;Long live the Emperor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97685;Demand promotion of the Japanese Army for military exercises.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA97686;We will accept the terms of peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA98100;Support the reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98105;They will not get away with this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98200;We shall see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98205;We must drive them from our lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98206;They are colonial subjects, no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98210;We will annex the Natal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98211;We will maintain good relations with the British.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98212;We will not submit to British rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98213;War it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98215;An interesting development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98216;There will be a reckoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98225;Whoever wishes to go may leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98230;We will abide by their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98235;They are proving to be a nuisance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98240;This is for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98241;We will agree to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98245;They will submit, or else!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98246;We fight with Transvaal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98247;Let us reconcile with the Boers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98248;That’s good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98249;We shall accept their surrender nevertheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98250;We have no choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98255;This is beyond the pale!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98256;Then so must it be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98260;A fine idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98261;This is necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98262;Great!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98300;We must maintain stability even in a time of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98301;This is unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98302;We shall see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98310;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have spoken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98400;We welcome all who wish to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98405;Whoever wishes to go may leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98600;We will make the request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98605;Grant $FROMCOUNTRY$ its freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98606;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98607;We are most fortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98610;Then it is war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98611;Attempt to find allies… quietly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98612;Agree to the alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98613;It gives us hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98614;Bah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98620;This is how it must be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98625;Tradition will be maintained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98626;Order must be restored. Abrogate the constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98630;This cannot be permitted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98635;We cannot allow them to spread unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98636;This is unacceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98640;Long live $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98641;We will drive the Rassids out of Yemen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98642;Onwards, to Fashoda!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA98646;We need to put up with him for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98647;They will pay for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA98649;Long Live the King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98650;We will accept the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98651;Then we shall claim them by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98655;Excellent news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98656;Then we end it here. This is not an option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98657;Then we end it here. The federation will not come to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA98722;Let the war begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98723;It’s about time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98724;The time has come to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98725;We will lead the Arab world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA98800;An excellent development!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA99000;We shall remain silent… for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA99001;Should we be alarmed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA99005;Look the other way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA99006;This cannot be tolerated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA99010;Declare support for the Boxers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA99011;This calls for intervention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA99015;We have little option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

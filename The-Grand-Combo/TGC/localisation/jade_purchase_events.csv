EVTNAME40001;The Jade Territory purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC40001;An envoy has approached us, informing us of his government's intention to purchase 340 hectares of land near the Jade Bight in order to establish a naval base there. He offers a generous payment of 30.000 Taler as compensation for cession of what would essentially amount to the territories of Heppen and Faehrhuck. This arrangement could rid us of a thinly populated area and help us settle outstanding legal disputes with the territories of Kniphausen and Varel regarding inheritance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT40001OPTA;Sell the territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT40001OPTB;The Jade Bight belongs to us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME40002;They accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC40002;The negotiations were successful! In return for a payment of 30.000 Taler, the territories of Heppen and Faehrhuck have been transferred to us. Our officials will immediately assess the purchased land and prepare plans for its further development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME40003;They refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC40003;The negotiations have broken down as it slowly became clear that an agreement could not be reached.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT40003OPTA;A hit to our international standing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME40004;Starting construction;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC40004;Chief of the commission Gotthilf Heinrich Ludwig Hagen has finished his own plan for the new naval base and its supporting infrastructure after rejecting several other proposals. Envisioning fortifications, accomodation for navy personnel and several harbor facilities, the plans conform to our as of yet moderate requirements but nevertheless allow for expansion over the next decades. With the creation of the Royal Prussian Admiralty Commission in Oldenburg, the responsible authority for our new acquisition, we can now begin construction work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT40004OPTA;But how should we call it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME40005;Wilhelmshaven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC40005;In $YEAR$, the new $COUNTRY_ADJ$ North Sea port began operating. The presence of thousands of construction workers and navy personnel has turned the previously rural backwater into a bustling port town and attracted members of other professions as well, though shipyards and the navy remain the most important employers. As harbor extensions and new canals are already being discussed to meet the growing demands of our fleet, the port has undoubtedly become the most important base for our naval operations in the North Sea. Originally called Zollern by the Sea, the growing town was named after Emperor Wilhelm I. in 1869.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

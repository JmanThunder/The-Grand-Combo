The Great Powers are fearful of this prospect and have offered to help us to demark the border and settle all remaining disputes for once and all.

reassert_kopet_dag_mountains_desc;The Turkmen tribes of the Kopet Dag mountains hold nominal allegiance to our throne but, recognising only clan and tribal authority, they are in effect beyond the pale of the state.

EVTNAME190300;A New Faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190300;A new heretical religious movement is forming in our lands, as a man proclaiming himself 'the Bab' is doing away with the old interpretations of the Quran. Instead he is offering his own interpretation of the text, looking for hidden meaning behind every individual letter. His radical new interpretation already sits poorly with the ulama -the religious authorities-, but his claim to authority to do so is what really infuriates them. He claims that the Qa'im [the redeemer] has arrived and that his is in contact with Him [he is the gate -Bab- to the Qa'im].\n\nNot satisfied with proclaiming himself just the Bab, in his rising popularity he is now proclaiming that he is indeed the Qa'im himself. And as Qa'im he has the authority to abrogate the Sharia. An act which was pushing it to far for the ulama: They have declared his movement heretical and are demanding that the Bab be put to death as an apostate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190301;He Whom God Shall Make Manifest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190301;One of the core teachings of the heretic the Bab is the imminent arrival of 'He whom God shall make manifest', or the messiah who shall establish God's kingdom on Earth. Long have the Babis been on the lookout for such a man, and now one by the name of Baha'u'llah claims to be him. While incarcerated in the Siyah-Chal prison, he claims to have had a a vision from the 'Maid of Heaven' proclaiming him the 'best beloved of the worlds' and having the 'power of the Sovereign within him.' In other words, he is the one prophesied.\n\nBaha'u'llah's claim is rapidly gaining acceptance among the Babis, and his presence in our realm is sure to reinvigorate the Babi cause and increase their militancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190302;The Babi faith is a radical renewal of the Islamic faith, and has been condemned in $FROMCOUNTRY$ as heretical. Under pressure from the conservative clergy, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ state has taken to violently repressing this new faith. As such many of the Babi adherends are fleeing $FROMCOUNTRY$, and some have found a safe haven in our realm. Amongst these people is a man named Baha'u'llah, who claims to the fulfilment of the Babi prophecy of there coming a man 'whom God shall make manifest' and restore the kingdom of God to Earth. With this claim he is rapidly absorbing leadership of the Babi movement and turning it into the Baha'i Faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190303;Baha'i Followers in $PROVINCENAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190303;A prominent scholar belonging to the herretical Baha'i sect has taken up residence in $PROVINCENAME$. An expert in Islamic scripture and jurisprudence, his knowledge has allowed him to establish himself as a religious authority in $PROVINCENAME$. People flock to him for advice and rulings. With his growing influence grows his ability to convert people away from the true path and unto the herretical Baha'i path. Not only does this mean he is leading people to eternal damnation, the Baha'i have shown themselves to be enemies of the state and their growth is a threat to the stability of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190304;The Tobacco Fields of Persia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190304;Ever since tobacco was introduced into Persia last century, the Persians have taken a great liking to its use. It has become a staple of life for both men and women: many men spending their spare time in the great coffee houses smoking. It should come as no surprise then that tobacco cultivation has taken off massively in Persia, with over 200,000 people employed in the sector at this moment. Blessed with excellent soil and a good climate the Persian tobacco is of excellent quality. As a result some of the varieties of Persian tobacco are much prized in foreign markets. Yet until this moment in time there has been no foreign penetration of the tobacco trade in Persia: the entire market is still controlled by the Persians themselves.\n\nA group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ entrepeneurs have now taken it upon themselves to change this, and are looking to enter into a deal with the Shah to gain control over the tobacco trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190305;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Tobacco Concession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190305;Ever since tobacco was introduced into Persia last century, our people have taken a great liking to its use.

Blessed with excellent soil and a good climate the Persian tobacco is of excellent quality. As a result some of the varieties of our tobacco are much prized in foreign markets.\n\nWe've been approached by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ merchants hoping to get a concession to enter the market. In exchange for the exclusive rights to the purchasing and selling of tobacco, they offer us a significant boost to our treasury. However, giving how intertwined tobacco is with our culture, handing this industry over to foreigners might not sit well with our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190306;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Interferes in Persia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190306;Our legation in Tehran reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s are vying for a new trade concession in Persia. They have approached the Shah with an offer to take over the complete tobacco trade, from directly buying it from producers to selling it to users, both in Persia and abroad. As Persia produces a number of tobacco varieties much prized in Western markets, if the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s manage to secure this concession it is sure to become a profitable undertaking for them. However, given the deep roots the usage of tobacco has in Persian culture, a disruption of the supply networks could cause significant social unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190307;No Tobacco Concession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190307;Despite the best efforts of our entrepreneurs to enter into an amicable deal with the Shah of Persia, it seems he fears that interceding in the tobacco trade will cause civil unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190308;'In the name of God the Merciful, the Forgiving. Today the use of tunbaku and tobacco, in whatever fashion, is reckoned as war against the Imam of the Age (may God hasten his glad advent)' -Mohammad Hasan Shirazi.\n\nProminent members of the ulama have issued fatwas condemning the buying and selling of tobacco from infidels and kafirs to be haram.\n\nSurely this is nothing but a effort for the ulama to undermine the Tobacco Regie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190309;The Tobacco Protests;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190309;'Most Persian would rather forego bread than tobacco, and the first thing they would do at the breaking of the fast during the month of Ramadan was to light their pipes.' -European observer\n\nFeeling their livelihood threatened by the Tobacco Regie, the bazaari have come out in protest against it en masse. While previously such protests remained a local affair -as the ulama could be counted on to quell the unrest- the current protests are of a different order. With the help of the anjomans (secret societies) the bazaari have mobilised popular support nationwide, while the ulama seems -following the infamous tobacco fatwa- to have a change of heart and are now coming out against the Regie. In line with the fatwa and ulama, many have now sworn to forgo smoking, including the leading Mujtahed Ashtiyani. Such is the extent of the protests that even the harem ladies forgo smoking, and our servants no longer prepare the water pipe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190310;Our Monopoly in Persia Rescinded;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190310;'Most Persian would rather forego bread than tobacco, and the first thing they would do at the breaking of the fast during the month of Ramadan was to light their pipes.' -European observer\n\nThe Tobacco Regie has long been unpopular with the Persian peoples, but the Shah has managed to keep control with the help of his clergy. This all changed when a promiment religious scholar issued a fatwa (religious rulling) declaring it forbidden for Muslims to consume tobacco sold by 'infidels' and 'foreigners'. Since then the - previously allied to our interests - clergy have joined in the protest, and many in Persia have stopped smoking. Such is the extend of the protests that even the Shah's harem ladies refuse to smoke, and his servents refuse to prepare his water pipe. Faced with such popular opposition, the Shah saw no other choice but to rescind the Tobacco Regie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190311;The Plot of Amir Kabir;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190311;Amir Kabir has shown himself to be an administative reformer without equal. Throughout his tenure he passed a wide variety of administrative, cultural, and economic reforms, most immediately a vaccination campaign against smallpox. While his reforms have proven to be valuable for the realm, it is not without its opposition. One of the most thorough reforms has been of the civil service, with salaries reduced and many superfluous offices abolished. This has greatly reduced expenses and strengthened the position of the central government, but it has also upset a large number of nobles who lost their patronage. Together with Tanzimat inspired breaking of the ulama, the reforms have given the central government undisputed authority. But not just of the central authority, but also of Amir Kabir. He is slowly becoming the government himself. Persistance rumours exist that these reforms have been passed to pave the way for Amir Kabir's ascession as Shah...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190312;Renovations of the Golestan Palace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190312;The Golenstan Palace in Tehran was build during the reign of Tahmasp I of the Safavid dynasty. It was last renovated by during the Zand dynasty, before Tehran was even selected as capital and Golestan became the official seat of government. As such the palace can no longer be considered fit for purpose as our seat of government and desperately needs to be expanded. To the east of the current palace there is an large empty lot which is just asking for the palace to be expanded upon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190313;The Death of Mohammad Shah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190313;The Shah has died today at the age of 40. Throughout his life Mohammed had been known to be somewhat sickly, and he finally died from complications arising from his gout in the Mohammadieh Palace. Mohammed was the son of Abbas Mirza and became crown prince upon his father's unexpected passing. Mohammed is succeeded by Naser-Al-Din.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190314;Jamal al-Din al-Afghani;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190314;'How very strange it is that the Moslems study those sciences that are ascribed to Aristotle with the greatest delight, as if Aristotle were one of the Moslems. However, if the discussion relates to Galileo, Newton, and Kepler, they consider them infidels. The father and the mother of science is proof, and proof is neither Aristotle nor Galileo. The truth is there is proof, and those who forbid science and knowledge in the belief that they are safeguarding the Islamic religion are really enemies of that religion.'\nThe famous reformer and political activist Jamal al-Din al-Afghani has decided to offer his services to your court. An outspoken critic of Western Imperialism, he advocates a reformed Islamic faith and pan-Islamic unity as the only way of staving of foreign domination. He argues that this can only be achieved by adopting a rationist mindset and fully embracing modern science. Though his reformist mindset has let to accusations of atheism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190315;The Assassination of Naser al-Din;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190315;The Shah has been assassinated! Shot while visiting and praying at the shrine of Shah-Abdol-Azim. Shot with an old and rusty revolver. Shot by a man called Mirza Reza Kermani. During his public interrogation Mirza Reza revealed that the act was retribution for the ill treatment al-Afghani received at our court, as well as the inept and corrupt rule of the Shah. While most people abhor the murder of the Shah, there is some sympathy for Mirza Reza. For the Shah had long been thought of as selling the country to the infidel with his concessionary politics.\n\nThe Shah is succeeded by Mozaffar ad-Din Shah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190316;The Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190316;The Zoroastianers follow the ancient monotheistic teachings of the prophet Zoroaster. While in its heyday it was the state religion of the Persian Empire and had millions of followers, over the centuries the numbers dwindled and it the religion was slowely replaced by Islam as the religion of the Persian people. However, there are still those who practise this ancient religion in our empire. Being subject to the jizya as well as harrasment by Muslims, they are subject to both formal and informal persecution.\n\nThe Parsi people -Zoroastrian co-religionists from India- are appalled by the deplorable situation Zoroastrianists find themselves in our empire. To assist them they founded the Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund offering financial support to them. A Parsi embassy lead by Maneckji Limji Hataria has also arrived at court pleading the end of persecution of the Zoroastrianists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190317;Old and Modern Tehran;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190317;Tehran is undergoing growth and modernisation at a rapid pace. It is quickly becoming a metropolis worthy of our Empire. But with this growth and modernisation comes the need to replace older and outdated buildings, there is not unlimited supply of land of course. Eyes have fallen on the Golenstan Palace for redevelopment. It occupies a large section of the city, and was last renovated during the reigh of Naser-Al-Din Shah. It is old and starting to become dilapilated, not to mention is starting to look dated. Clearing out the palace would allow for the construction of a modern city in its place, or we could maintain it as a testatment to the history of our Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190318;The Persian Imperial Bank;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190318;Currently the economy can only be described as 'medieval.' The only form of currency currently in circulation are silver and gold coins. While -as charging interest is forbidden by Islamic law- the only money lenders are Jewish sarrafs. Who, due to this as well as cultural ties, dominate the money market. Modern financial instruments such as those known in the West are completely absent from the economy. Without access to easy credit and finance there has been little investment in the country and economic development has been stagnant.\nSensing an opportunity to both make money and strengthen Persia, we've been approached by Baron de Reuter who proposes the founding of a modern -Western- financial institution: the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Imperial Bank. By mobilising the savings of the Persian people capital would become available for the development of the country. In exchange Baron de Reuter ask for exclusive banking rights and mining concessions for all newly discovered mineral deposits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190319;The Great Famine of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190319;The past winter the rains have utterly failed, with only the southern and western provinces being blessed with any precipitation at all. Other regions haven't seen a single drop of rain in over two years. This has left the land scorch dry as not even rivers and wells can supply enough water to maintain farming levels. As harvests fail a major famine is developing. Bread is getting scarcer resulting in the price of bread doubling in Tehran, tripling in Isfahan and increasing more than 20 fold in some rural areas. As a result of these high prices those still holding grain have started hoarding their supply in the hopes of fetching a premium. Reports have reached us that one provincial governor banned the import of grain in the hopes of driving up the value of his own stock.\n\nThis all resulted in the common people starving and bread riots being a daily occurance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190320;Salam-e Shah\n[The National Anthem];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Proclaiming himself to be the promised Mujaddid of the age - the renewer which shows up once per century to revive Islam, cleansing it of extraneous elements and restoring it to its pristine purity. This Mirza Ghulam Ahmad fellow mananges to convince may with his deep knowledge of theology, both Christian and Islamic, and orating skills. Apparently he spend a great deal of his youth studying Christian and Islamic texts, while also debating Christian missionaries earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190322;The Ahmaddiyya Muslim Jama'at;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190322;Some time ago a fellow by the name of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad started proclaiming himself the Mujaddid in one of our provinces in India. Not satisfied with his claim of being the devinely inspired reformer of Islam, he has now added to his claim the assertion that he is the Mahdi, the promised Messiah. Apparently, he is quite successful with his claims, as he rapidly gained a following. Even managing to extract a personal pledge of allegiance from 40 followers. With it he has founded his own faith community: The Ahmaddiyya Muslim Jama'at.\nHowever, while he may be gaining followers, not everybody is convinced of claim to be the Mahdi. Many consider him to be a heretic and are demanding that his works be condemned: a fatwa declaring him a kafir, liar and deceiver was signed by over 200 clergymen. While a religious opinion issued by scholars at Mecca and Medina declare Ghulam Ahmad's beliefs blasphemous and tantamount to apostasy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190323;Amir Arsalan-e Namdar\n[The Story of Arsalan];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190323;Our chief story teller has composed a new story for our entertainment: the Amir Arsalan-e Namdar\n\nArsalan was born after his pregnant mother -queen of Roum- was forced to flee her kingdom. She becomes wedded to an Egyptian merchant and gives birth to her child, Arsalan. The merchant claims the child as his own. Naturally Arsalan learns the truth of his royal origin, and sets out to avenge his father and reclaim his throne. Later he falls in love with Farrok-leqa, who is later killed, revived and carried of by a hand from the clouds. A series of adventures, including being saved from the gallows by an afreet, leads him to another land where he is reunited with Farrok-leqa. And they live happily ever after.\n\nThe story has become a court favourite, with the Shah's daughter transcribing the story herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190324;A Cup of Tea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190324;For a long period of time coffee had been the national drink of our people. With smoking in coffee houses being a national past time. However As most coffee producing regions are located far away, making shipping difficult and expensive, it is a pleasure few can afford. As the the tea producing regions of India and China are nearer to $COUNTRY$, tea has proven tea highly priced -cheaper- alternative to coffee. This has caused a gradual shift away from coffee towards tea over the past the decades, leaving tea the national drink\n\nBut like coffee, tea still has to be imported. To remedy this it has been suggested we start our own tea plantations. The region around Rasht, with its mild weather, plenty of precipitation and good -slightly acidic- soil, seems to be a good contendor. However, as tea is one of the most valuable produces of British India, the British might not take well to us establishing our own tea industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190325;Berigad-e Qazzaq\n[The Persian Cossacks];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190325;The Persian army's performance in relation to its Western counterparts has so far proven to be less than satisfactionary. Even the elite Royal Cavalry has dissappointed. Western observers who have observed them have often derisively commented on their preformance, calling them 'untrained and undisciplined'.\nDuring our travels in Europe the Russian Cossacks displayed particular rigor in their skill and ability. It has been suggested we apply for Russian support, and start training our own Caucasian population in the manner of the Russian Cossack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190326;A Promising Officer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190326;The Persian Cossacks have proven to be the most effective military unit in our arsenal. As such it has become a proving ground for young and ambitious officers. Originally not a path for political advancement -orginally only Caucasian muhajirs could become officers, often through inheritence-, but with Persians now swelling the ranks the Cossacks have become a recruiting ground for political talent. One particular officer -by the name of Reza Khan- has caught attention. Said to be highly intelligent and extremely charasmatic. He has a keen mind for matters of state and modernising the establishment and, with some support, he could go far in our administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190327;The Swedish Gendarmerie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190327;The Constitutional Revolution has left our central authority fractured and weakend. A power vacuum has emerged in the country side which is leading to distrubances. Without central authority, bandits are left free to roam. Such a burden to commerce have these bandits become that the British are now demanding we either deal with, or accept that they will.\n\nLacking a effective police force to deal with the bandits, it has been suggested we contact a neutral European power for help to establish a highway gendarmerie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190328;The Mashrutiyyat\n[Constitutional Revolution];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190328;Our dire financial situation and general weakness has left our court to be behold of foreign interests, with the Shah being little more than a figurehead while infidels run the country. Infidels to whom our natural resources are being pandered, and all to pay of debts caused by government extravagance. Instead of investing in and strengthening the country, the whole system seems to only serve to enrich the rich and impoverish the common folk.\nThe repaying of foreign debt has become quite the contentious issue, especially among the bazaari. Protests against high taxes and tariffs are common, but the bastinadoing of a bazaari for a minor offence has made things come to a head. Massive protests have broken out all over Tehran, and the bazaari have -with the full support of the ulama- closed down the bazaar! Their demands: The removal of offending government figures, the implementation of a constitution and the creation of a parliament to oversee the government financing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190329;Unrest in Khorasan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190329;The upheaval of the Constitutional Revolution has left central authority fractured and weakend.

With the province now becoming the domain of more or less independent warlords, the province is rapidly becoming unsafe to travel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME190330;Khorasan Rebels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190330;The unrest of Khorasan has reached such a degree that an enterprising colonel by the name of Pessian has decided to take matters into his own hands.

With his own hands he removed the cap from his head, with his own hands he raised and assumed the crown, while two ministers stood by, holding the dishonored tiaras of the Kajar dynasty.

Something which can only be considered a clear provocation by the Muslims populace, though some claim it was a veiled women who put it there.

However, while most enthusiasticly joined in, as the ban dragged on many found that stopping smoking was more difficult than anticipated. Not only is smoking thoroughly ingrained in Persian culture, it is also terribly addictive. As time wore on slowly people started circumventing the ban and started smoking again. As the fatwa lost influence, so did the hold of the ulama on the people decline.

Nayeb Isa may have claimed he was fulfilling the people's wishes by removing Said-Mohammed Khan, but his actions are rapidly turning Herat into a lawless place. What is worse, however, is that Nayeb Isa has, without consulting us, executed Said-Mohammed Khan and appropriated his, and all his family's, property.

The city had been ruled by Said-Mohammed Khan with Persian blessings, but recently he is said to have suffered from bouts of insanity. His rule becoming ever more erratic, his deputy -Nayeb Isa Khan- deposed him. Arguing that was the will of the people to rid them of their insane ruler. However, Herat has always been considered a principality under Persian suzerainty. This change of ruler was not approved by Persia and, what is worse, Nayeb Isa had Said-Mohammed executed and his property confiscated. Such an affront to their honour and authority the Persians could net let slight. They have declared war on Nayeb Isa.\n\nThus far we have considerd this to be an internal matter for the Persians to sort out.

EVTNAME190359;The Unveiled Protest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190359;According to Islamic law it is forbidden for a women to be in contact with a unrelated male, they are even barely allowed to show themselves to unrelated males. This has left women to spend most of their lives in the private world of the family. So engrained in our culture has this become that a common name for a wife is manzel: 'the home.' Rich or poor, women are confined to, and devote their entire lives to, the family. Unless girls are born into well-to-do families, their birth is less enthusiastically welcomed. In some families it has gotten to the point that it is a nang (social disgrace) to give birth to girls.\nYet women are not some mindless automaton, they have a will and mind of their own. Sensing the opportunities the Constitutional Movement -with its focus on modernising- offers, the women of Tehran have now taken to the streets demanding equal treatment. Most notably, they are removing the veil while shouting 'Long live freedom!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC190360;'Behind the closed doors at home, prohibted from everything in life, education, training and social life, women are regarded as mindless, like infants: they are confined to the burdens of household work and childbearing and are considered the slaves and servants of their husands.'\nThe position of women in our society is poor to say the least. Forbidden by Islamic law to interact with, or even being seen by, unrelated males, women live a hidden life behind closed doors. On the rare occasions that they do venture out, they do so 'wrapped in black bags from head to the toe without even an opening to breathe.' Yet, it would be a mistake to consider women to be powerless bystanders. From the tobacco protests to the Constitutional Revolution, they have been at the forefront of all public protests in recent history. Yet society does not recognise this. Within our modernising government it has been suggested we liberate women from the veil, or at least in public institutions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The journal is named after Molla Nasreddin a 13th century cleric who had a nack for telling amusing tales and anecdotes. The journal, however, is more than just a collection of amusing tales and anecdotes. It is a poignant satire of the clergy and the establishmen and is more than happy to expose its corruption. But more than that, the paper is a call to modernise and accept more advanced Western social norms and practises. It viciously attacks what it preceives to be the backward lifestyles and values of the Islamic clergy and religious fanatics.\nBeing richly illustrated it is not only accessable to the literate elite, but has also become an hit among the lower -illiterate- classes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190363;Published in Tiflis and smuggled across the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ border, Molla Nasreddin is a satirical journal which is rapidly gaining a following in our country. Combining poetry with beautiful illustrations, the journal is not only read by the literate classes but also by the illiterate peasants. All to the chagrin of the ulama. Molla Nasreddin likes nothing more than taking jabs at the ulama's preceived backward lifestyle and values. Contrasting their fanaticism with the enlightend values of the West, the journal calls upon all to throw off the shackles of superstition and adopt advanced Western social normes and practises.\nBut more than an advocate of Westernisation, Molla Nasreddin is a fierce opponent of absolutism and imperialism. It vicously attacks our Qajar dynasty for it corruption and foreign influence, which leaves many starving and the country's natural wealth in the hands of foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

However power by far and large still resides with the old elites who are thoroughly uninterested in economic reform, and would rather enrich themselves at the expense of the tojjar. We've been approached by a small group of tojjar who are demanding the removal of the ineffective and corrupt government officials and replace them with religious, unbiased and not avaricious men. Futhermore they are demanding we install merchants' assemblies in prominent cities and ports to represent the merchants interests and settle matters of commercial disputes, while promoting commerce and protecting merchants from foreign competition.\nThe old elites, however, feeling threatend in their position, have allied with the the ulama in opposition to the formation of these merchant councils.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

One of the greatest opponents of the ulama is prime-minister Amir Kabir. Who, while working for the border committee insituted by the Second Treaty of Erzurum, closely followed the Tanzimat reforms of the Ottoman Empire and came to the conclusion that the only way to modernise and strengthen the empire is by limiting the power and influence of the ulama.\nHe has now proposed measures just to this effect.

But where the anjoman find fertile ground for growth among the more reform minded classes -and are slowly readying the minds of the general populace for change- the ulama is less than enthusiastic of their ideas. In their eyes many of the anjoman serve to spread corrupt ideas, shelter infidels, promote harmony between Muslims and non-Muslims, and, above all, constitute religious innovation contrary to Islamic precepts. As a result, the ulama is demanding we shut down the anjoman whereever we find them, the Faramus-kana foremost among them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC301007;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Grand Designs for Central Asia are starting to interfere with our just claims to the regions. Already the great Khanate of Khiva has been subdued, while it seems only a matter of time untill the other Khanates follow suit. All the while it seems exceedingly unlikely we will be able to turn this trend.\n\nA Russian diplomatic mission has arrived in $CAPITAL$ to discuss just this issue. They propose that, in the interest of avoiding unnecessary conflict, a clear border is defined. The border they are insisting on however would see us loose all our claims and territories in Turkestan. Accepting this proposal would go a long way to stabilise our relations and prevent future conflict. Relinquishing our ancient claims would however also be greatly humiliating and very unpopular at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301008;In their infinite wisdom, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s have agreed to our proposal and will evacuate all territories in Turkestan!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301009;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s seem to understand that resisting our Designs for Central Asia is pointless, and have agreed to withdraw to south of the Atreck River.

The Turkmen peoples of the Kopet Dag are no different.

EVTDESC301014;The Persian attempts to re-establish control over the Kopet Dag mountains have caused a substantial number of Turkmen tribesmen to move north, many of whom have decided to settle in the Merv oasis.

EVTNAME301015;The Treaty of Shiraz;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301015;Without our knowledge or approval the governor of Shiraz has entered into a treaty with the British Resident at Bushire concerning the future of Bahrain. The governor managed to convince the Resident to support our title to the island, and even to offer ships to establish our authority. However word has now reached us from Bombay that the British are refusing to fulfil the terms of the agreement, claiming that, as both the resident of Bushire and the governor of Shiraz exceeded their authority, the treaty of null and void. Without British approval or support, taking Bahrain might prove costly. However, this treaty might prove useful in the future to support our claim to Bahrain.\nHow shall we proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301016;A clandestine treaty was signed recently between the British resident in Bushere and the Persian governor of Shiraz which obligated the British to help the Persians conquer us!

EVTDESC301017;As word leaked of a treaty signed between the Persians and the British which would put Bahrain under the suzerainty of the Shah, the Sheik of Bahrain started looking abroad for support.

EVTNAME301020;Incident at the Russian Legation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301020;Outrage has erupted over actions of the Russian Envoy in Tehran. Under the terms of the Treaty of Turkmenchay he has granted asylum to an Armenian court eunuch and his extended family. Anti-Russian sentiment which had long been simmering following the recent Russian actions in the Caucasus, have now come to full eruption. An angry mob has gathered at the Russian Legation demanding the return of the eunuch.\n\nEncouraged by opportunistic mullahs, the calls for the return of the Eunuch are growing ever more radical, and the situation is quickly spiralling out of control... Forcing the Envoy to hand over the eunuch would satisfy the crowd, but also anger the Russians. Dispersing the crowd on the other hand would mean accepting this affront to our honour...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301021;Incident at the Tehran Legation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301021;One hour, that is how long they lasted. Alexander Griboyedov and his brave Cossack guards. One hour, in full uniform, before the mob broke through the ceiling and slaughtered all of them. Fighting with pistol, sword, broomstick, anything, they held bravely. All the while the Persian authorities watched. Thrown from the window, decapitated, dragged through the streets and bazaars... Griboyedov's head put on display at a local kebab place, his body identifiable only through a small duelling injury to his finger... And what did Alexander Griboyedov do to deserve this? He rightfully protected an Armenian eunuch and two Georgian girls who wished to escape the imperial harem and move to freedom in Armenia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301022;The Death of Alexander Griboyedov;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301022;Yes, the storming of the Russian legation and decapitation of the Russian envoy was an unfortunate incident, but not unjustified. When Alexander Griboyedov refused to hand over the eunuch and the girls, it was quite clear something was up. Fearing for the honour of the women, the mob stormed the embassy to free and protect them. And loo and behold, they found them, raped by Griboyedov. What was the crowd to do but execute Griboyedov publicly? Yet the Russians are screaming murder, and are demanding retribution for his death!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC301025;An unexpected guest arrived at court today: the grandson of the Shah himself! And he comes baring gifts. 88.7 carats worth of gifts: the Shah Diamond. Taken as a war trophy by the Persians almost 100 years ago, it is one of the most treasured heirlooms of the Persian court. And today it is offered as a sincere apology for the events surrounding the Tehran legation, should we choose to forget that unfortunate incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC301031;The incident at the Russian Legation had quickly spiralled out of control when the mob stormed the building and found that the envoy, Alexander Griboyedov, had raped the women who had sought refuge at the Legation. The crowd, enraged by what they found, quickly took Griboyedov outside and publicly executed him. An unfortunate, but not unjustified, act. The Russians might, however, have viewed this attack on their legal representative differently, perhaps even angrily. For weeks we have waited on a Russian response, yet none has come. Not even a rider with an official message.\nPerhaps the Russians aren't as fearsome as we thought?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301032;A Persian Adventure;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301032;The Shah of Persia has found himself in somewhat of a pickle after a rousey rabble stormed the Russian Legation in Tehran and killed the envoy Alexander Griboyedov. Apparently Griboyedov stuck his head in some nasty business involving an eunuch and two former harem girls, and the Persians did not take kindly to this. Decapitated, body mutilated, head found on display at a local kebab place, just terrible. The Russians are, understandably, somewhat upset about this, and are threatening war to avenge Griboyedov. The Shah, not one to risk losing another war to Russia, has appealed to us for protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

While at the same time the governor of Van has been instigating rebellion among the Azeri tribes along the border. Lastly, we should not forget the Wahabis raiding our pilgrims to Mecca and Karbala, something the Ottomans are not combatting and sometimes engaging in themselves.\nShould we decided to press the issue, the Russian Tsar has promised his support.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC301053;'Caucasus! Bow down your snowy head.\nSubmit! Yermolov Marches!' - Pushkin\n\nThe Treaty of Gulistan was supposed to end the struggle over the Caucasus between the Russian Empire and us. However tensions remain high as ever, and peace is bought at a bloody price as Russian Viceroy Yermolov employs a reign of terror to subdue the Caucasian tribes. Yet that is not the only source of tension: Yermolov accusses us of not fulfilling the territorial clauses of the Treaty, claiming Kapan belongs to Russia. Of course, it does not, but he has occupied the northern shore of lake Gokcha -a position from where he can threaten Erivan- to force us to the negotation table. How should we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

Unfortunately we must conclude that the Persians have failed to abide by the treaty, and we suspect they actively support the rebels.\nUnder the Treaty of Gulistan the region around Kapan was to be seceded to us by the Persians, yet nothing could motivate the Persians to evacuate the region. In a bold move, the governor of Tiflis Yermolov has now seized the northern shore of Lake Gokcha [Gyumri] as just compensation for the territory we lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

Yermolov, claiming we have failed in our obligation to evacuate Kapan, continues to press our northern border. Now he has seized control over more territory around Lake Gokcha, and is now in a position to directly threaten Erivan. Yet this aggressive action belies the truth of the Russian's situation: Their empire is at the verge of civil war, with Russian princes are at eachother's throat, fighting for the throne. There are those who say the time to strike Russians is now: To avenge the continued humilation the Russians subject us too and liberate our Muslim brethren from Yermolov's oppression!

EVTNAME301059; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301059;The Council of Sultanieh -the yearly army army review and the opportunity to pay homage to the Persian Shah- was quite an eventful occassion this year. Wild voices were pushing for war, to restore the Persian Empire in the Caucasus and, by radical fanatics -the ulama- in specific, to avenge the 'atrocities' commit against the peoples of the Caucasus. Yet we also had allies at court arguing for restraint and the futility of war against us. In the end, however, the deciding voice was our emissary who mananged to covince the Shah that there was no ill will on our part. His audience with the Shah was even so successful, that the Shah has resorted to settling some minor border disputes around $PROVINCENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC301060;Yermolov is making outrages accusation to our adress: He purported to have intercepted a caravan leaving Erivan carrying silver and arms for the Caucasians fighting their Russian oppressors. He claims that these actions were directed by Abbas Mirza under a policy of 'no peace, no war', which aims to strengthen Mirza's position as crown prince by stirring up trouble for the Russians in the Caucasus. Yermolov is demanding the right to build military posts on the road from Tabriz to Erivan to intercept future shipments of arms destined for the rebels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME301061; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301061;Long have we suspected the court of Tabriz of stirring up trouble in the Caucasus under a policy of 'no peace, no war' in order to strengthen Abbas Mirza's claim to the Persian throne. And recently we finally found the evidence we need: A caravan leaving from Erivan carrying Persian silver and arms destined for the Caucasian rebels. Viceroy Yermolov has now moved to quickly block the road from Tabriz to prevent future shipments!\n[You gained Nakhichevan];;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME301062;The Khanate of Erivan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301062;Yermolov has used his positions in Nakhichevan to close off all lines of communication between Tabriz and Erivan. It is now effectively cut off from our empire! As for the motivation for Yermolov to do so? We can only guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301063;Despite out best efforts to find an amicable settlement in the Caucasus, the Persians persist in trying to undermine our position there. Even more evidence has emerged detailing the involvement of Tabriz and Erivan in the war. As a result, Viceroy Yermolov has now blockaded Erivan to force them into submission, and end their support for the rebels. The Shah has made it known to us that he had no knowledge of the involvement of Erivan in the affair, and leaves it to us how to settle the matter with the court of Erivan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

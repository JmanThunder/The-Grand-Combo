EVTDESC9990001;Tragedy befalls our blighted nation! The king himself has perished defending the capital from invading devils creating a succession crisis in a nation already in turmoil. Powerful voices within the nation suggest offering the crown to Bohemia to create a more powerful state out of both, though others perhaps rightly argue that it would be no different than allowing the annexation of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990002;With the death of their king and the ruin of the nation in war the Austrians have come to us begging for protection, they offer no less than their Crown for our King, shall we oblige them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC16400;Yesterday morning we received a petition from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Congress, requesting Statehood in our nation. A state constitution has been submitted, along with maps defining the state's territorial boundaries. Common opinion seems to hold it a forgone conclusion that we will accept this petition for statehood, and forever join $FROMCOUNTRY$ into our glorious nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97085;Jidligribi forces have occupied more of the lands in the southern continent. The pacification of the local natives is ongoing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC9990005;After 60 long years on the throne Sultan Garsiyya Al-Barasya, founder of our great nation has passed away peacefully. Though the Sultanate was established to protect our noble way of life from destructive revolutionary ideals relations with the north have been strong for years, with our economy increasingly dependent on the Yanqui. With his dying breath Garsiyya has disavowed his heir and stipulated that the monarchy be abolished and Barasya join in union with Amrekeyah, sending shockwaves through the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95500;The colonial powers of the world have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the regulation of colonization and trade in India. The outcome has become known as the 'General Act of the $CAPITAL$ Conference', formalizing the scramble for the Indian sub-continent. After this point, any civilized country will largely be seen as justified in aggression towards uncivilized Indian nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95501;The Scramble for India;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95501;A conference has been held in $FROMCOUNTRY$, attended by all colonial powers, to discuss the regulation of colonization and trade in India. A general agreement has been reached, formalizing the scramble for the Indian continent. After this point, any civilized country will largely be seen as justified in aggression towards uncivilized Indian nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95502;The Age of Colonialism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95502;Word has reached $COUNTRY$ of a great meeting of colonial powers in Europe, wherein it was decided that Indian nations would be divided up amongst them-- as if our people were little more than children's toys discarded and left waiting to be picked up. This has caused a great deal of concern among those of our people with the knowledge to understand what this means. For others it has brought little more than resentment, as well as vows to fight for our independence when the day comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC9990006;Though long reliant on our rightful rule for support against Russian expansion the settlers of the northern plains, mostly converted Slavs have begun to develop a sense of self and many in the province speak of the Ukraynan nation under Ottoman rule rather than the Ottoman province.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990007;A recent meeting of the Ukraynan national congress has drafted a set of demands for limited self rule under our administration, though accepting would go a long way to ensuring stable rule in the north it would set a precedent our other national minorities would sure to take note of.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990008;The die has been cast, the Ukraynans have presented us with one final attempt at compromise, full autonomy and nothing less. It appears the only way to avoid war is to comply though this will surely embolden other nationalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990009;Following our compromise with the Ukraynans another nationality within our empire has sent a set of similar demands,;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990010;Though we initially declined their demands the granting of another entity sub-national institutions has fanned the flames, refusing again would mean war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990017;Since the ascension of the Yuxun Emperor the restrictions of movement have been lifted, along with a general cessation of central authority to the hands of local warlords. With these changes the ethnic divisions in the country have become pronounced, with the Chinese massing in the south and the locals migrating to the north with its looser authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990018;With the collapse of central authority in the reign of the Yuxun Emperor local warlords, many of them native have asserted control of the countryside. One of these warlords has gathered the Japanese of the north together and now marches on Kyoto to end our divine rule once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990019;All of the French people were once, albeit indirectly under the rule of the Norman crown before the sundering of the Grand Coalition. Though they may tear apart our nation they can never tear apart our hearts. France will be a nation once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990020;A storm brewing quietly under the surface has erupted, French nationalists have stormed Paris and now declare a Republic of France in our continental territory, for now the English remain loyal and the court has retreated to London.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990021;The boundary between Norman colonies and our own has always been murky at best, it's time we has out the details once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990023;Cries of Vive La France ring through the streets and Englishman arm themselves fearing lynchings, French Nationalism has reached a boiling point and now much of our populace stand behind the nationalists as they give us a single demand, remove England from the realm and accept the unification of France under their self proclaimed national congress.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990024;A delegation from the German national congress has approached us with an offer of joining in federation, they say our language unites us more than our religion divides. Shall we accept the offer?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990025;A vocal minority has begun rallying for us to extend an offer of federation to the Prussians, though we share many cultural and linguistic ties our religious differences could bring trouble in the future, shall we send them the offer?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990026;The Norman crown stands at the end of its golden age, defeated 20 years ago in the Grand Coalition it has been stripped of the title Holy Roman Emperor and much of its influence. Burgundy, once a province is now a nation. The Archduke of Guyenne, once a loyal vassal now pursues his own interests and the boards of the great trading companies of the east now serve no master aside from profits. Though Normandy is still a great power, perhaps the greatest, this sense of decline has lifted the spirits of nationalists on both sides of the channel. This is the dawning of a new age and only time will tell if it belongs to Normandy as the last did.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990027;BLOOD AND THUNDER!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990028;Lombardia has long stood in the shadow of Normandy, though with the aftermath of the Grand Coalition it appears ready to step into the light. Once more the crown of the Holy Roman Empire sits in Milan and while we have pledged to respect the independence of the heretics in Rome stewardship of the city passing from Normandy to the Knights brings the unification of Italy one step closer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990029;The last 50 years have been disastrous for the Badajozi Caliphate, economic ruin and the loss of the colonies bringing instability and civil war to the motherland. For a time Iberia was the battleground of the greater powers, throwing more men and more chaos behind causes they had no real support for. However with the death of the Norman Emperor on our soil the chaos gradually subsided and the Caliph has once again restored order, the time is ripe for Badajoz to rise again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990030;Though founded as a tool of the Norman crown the Archduchy of Guyenne has grown into a great power of its own since freed in the aftermath of the Grand Coalition and stands poised to achieve great things in its own name, the colony of Nou Provence is thriving and traders ply the Indian routes. Viua Guyenne!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990031;Though similar in many ways to other European nations most would say things are fundamentally different in Ireland, the great religions of Christianity and Islam never took hold and the people stick to their ancient traditions. Despite this they have spread to lands far and wide, and the Irish colonial empire was among the world's finest, today all that remains is a few stray islands and ports but the adventuring spirit has never left the isle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990032;Estonia sits in an uncomfortable position as of late, sandwiched between hostile heathen neighbours to the south and growing Scandinavian and Russian ambitions, of those options Scandinavian rule would be most preferable and with our strong cultural ties to them perhaps a union on favourable terms could be arranged?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990033;An Estonian envoy arrived today with a most tempting offer, the cession of Estonian territory and sovereignty to us in exchange for a set of local rights and freedoms and guarantees of protection for the Estonian language. Only one question remains, is Estonia Scandinavian?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990034;Our glorious republic has come into its own as of late, born through fire 50 years ago we now stand as the bastion of liberty and freedom in the world. Our people prosper and though divided by language and religion they remain united by revolutionary ideals. Many have begun trekking west into land loosely governed by the Knights and the glimmers of a great nation stretching from sea to sea can be seen forming. Let us liberate our brothers under the Norman yoke and rule this land in the name of freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990035;We stand at the deciding moment of what will surely go down as world changing debate, many voices among the senior knights have pointed to the massive settlement of Arabs from the east coast in our lands to say that our long standing policies to convert, educate and ultimately protect the natives are now pointless, that we must now more than ever use the bounties of the new world to secure a homeland for Christian Greeks. Others claim that that same Arab migration merely cements the need for our missionary work. Whichever argument proves more persuasive the consequences for the future of this land will be great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990036;Though successful in our quest to establish a modern state at the expense of the colonial powers the challenge of building a nation is far from over and the many native peoples of our lands are slow to accept the French language and modern ideals given to us by the Knights. Nonetheless the seeds of a great civilization to rival that of the Ancient Greeks or Romans have been planted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990037;The greatest hero of the revolution and Lord Protector in its final days, Lajos Batthyany has returned from exile in Corfu to the rousing applause of thousands, already soldiers flock to his banner and the rabble pronounce the return of the revolution. The situation may already be beyond our control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990038;Though once the mightiest of all Christian powers our fine Scandinavian nation has only now recovered from the long rape at the hands of Norman and Italian armies. There are no more burnt villages or salted fields, instead only abandoned ones as we sit and watch others surpass us by the fruit of their people's labour. However our greatest weakness may in time become a strength as the downtrodden of Europe look at us as a land of freedom and opportunity close to home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990039;For too long the world has sat idly by and watched itself decay, our "christian brothers" to the west bicker among themselves about popery and sugar colonies as the mohhamedan hordes sweep all in their path aside unopposed. However a rumble can be heard in the distance, a rumble of change and hope for the oppressed slavs of the world, the rumble of the Russian Bear about to wake. Tver is abuzz with expectation as talk of Russian unification, eastern expansion and the rescue of our Ukranian brothers from their self imposed exile in sin sweep the town, let us not fail those expectations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990040;Though Germanic in blood and language it is safe to say that Prussia belongs to the east far more than the west, first introduced by the Lithuanian horde Islam has planted itself as firmly on the Baltic coast as it has in Iberia. Where in other German towns church bells would ring in the day in Koenigsberg instead the Muezzin calls all to prayer. Nonetheless German nationalism, a significant force since the Grand Coalition has found a home here and a lively debate has emerged on what place Germany has in Islam, and Islam in Germany. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990041;We have failed to spread the revolution to our neighbours;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

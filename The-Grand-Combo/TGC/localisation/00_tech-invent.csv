13in_main_battery_desc;Our dreadnoughts are now equipped with 13.5-inch main guns, rather than 12-inch guns. This gives them more firepower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
15_inch_main_armament;15-inch Main Armament;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
15_inch_main_armament_desc;The main armament of the first dreadnoughts consisted in most cases of 12-inch or 13.5-inch guns, but modern navies soon began to desire a larger calibre main armament. This resulted in later battleships being armed with 15-inch or 16-inch main guns, which had significantly greater destructive power and range than their predecessors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

abraham_maslow;Abraham Maslow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
abraham_maslow_desc;Abraham Harold Maslow was an American psychologist who was best known for creating Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, a theory of psychological health predicated on fulfilling innate human needs in priority, culminating in self-actualization. Maslow was a psychology professor at Brandeis University, Brooklyn College, New School for Social Research and Columbia University. He stressed the importance of focusing on the positive qualities in people, as opposed to treating them as a ‘bag of symptoms’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
academic_training;Naval Academic Training;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
academic_training_desc;This meant that to become an officer it was no longer enough to be of gentle blood. You also had to attend a formal education which could at best be as good as any college. This was one of the most important causes behind the professionalization of the officers corps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
accelerated_vulcanization;Accelerated Vulcanization;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
accelerated_vulcanization_desc;It was discovered in the early Twentieth Century that the addition of the organic compound aniline produced an accelerating effect. The active zinc salts in the aniline react strongly with the zinc oxide present in sulphur-vulcanized rubber to decrease the cure time necessary. Other compounds were later used that provided even faster cure times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

adam_smith;Adam Smith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
adam_smith_desc;Adam Smith was a Scottish Enlightenment philosopher of political economy. He was author of The Theory of Moral Sentiments and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Smith promoted the central tenement of Capitalism as the individual pursuing his own self-interest, and in so doing, promoting the greater good. He talked about the ‘invisible hand’ that would guide the actions of individuals and argued against government interference in all but a few aspects of the economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
adolph_wagner;Adolph Wagner;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
adolph_wagner_desc;Although one of the more active members of Schmoller’s Verein, Wagner actually supported Menger in the Methodenstreit. His work on public finance is what he is best known for in economics. Outside economics, he was a companion of Lassalle and Rodbertus—although not sharing wholly in their socialist ideals and of more conservative instincts in political matters, Wagner was a severe critic of unfettered capitalism and recommended state alleviation of the burden upon labour. He wrote ‘Science of Finance Vol 1–4’ (1877–1901), and ‘Foundations of Political Economy’ (1876).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
advanced_battlecruisers;Advanced Battlecruisers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
advanced_battlecruisers_desc;In the immediate aftermath of the First World War, many battlecruisers under construction were scrapped or converted to aircraft cruisers. Those battlecruisers that remained were refitted with improved main armament and enhanced armour protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
advanced_battleships;Advanced Battleships;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
advanced_battleships_desc;The experiences of the First World War lead to a series of design improvements for battleships, including a more effective use of armour protection to defend against plunging fire, improved protection against torpedoes, the widespread use of oil-driven propulsion, and further refinements in armament and fire control. Though few battleships were constructed in the first years after the First World War, due to economic constraints and treaty limitations, existing battleships were refitted to incorporate these advances in design.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
advanced_cruisers;Advanced Cruisers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
advanced_cruisers_desc;By the early 1920s cruiser design focussed on two main types: light cruisers, generally with 6-inch main armament, and heavy cruisers, generally with 8-inch main armament. Their primary roles were fleet support in combination with destroyers, defence of sea lanes, and raiding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
advanced_destroyers;Advanced Destroyers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
advanced_destroyers_desc;The evolution of the submarine into a potent threat to warships and merchant ships alike resulted in the evolution of destroyers to assume the primary role for defending against them, as opposed to their former role of defending the main battle fleet from torpedo boats. Thus, the first years after the First World War saw improvements in destroyer design that aimed to enhance their ability to find and sink submarines, such as the implementation and refinement of SONAR.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

advanced_drilling_techniques_desc;New methods of pumping oil from the ground are becoming available, meaning that oil can be harvested in a far more efficient manner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
advanced_fire_control;Advanced Fire Control;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
advanced_fire_control_desc;Advances in main armament and warship construction resulted in capital ships with more and larger main guns, capable of firing shells over great distances. It became increasingly important to simultaneously develop advanced methods of measuring where shells landed and deriving, from these observations, accurate measurements of where the main guns should be aimed in order to achieve hits on enemy warships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

aerial_support;Aerial Support;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aerial_support_desc;The use of aircraft in the close air support of ground forces dates back to World War I, the first significant use of aerial units in warfare. Air warfare, and indeed aviation itself, was still in its infancy—and the direct effect of rifle calibre machine guns and light bombs of World War I aircraft was very limited compared with the power of a World War II fighter bomber, but close support aircraft still had a powerful psychological impact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aero_ap_shell;Aerodynamic Armour-Piercing Capped Shell;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aero_ap_shell_desc;Research shows that putting a cap of soft metal over the point of an armour-piercing shell makes it more effective. However, this makes the shell less aerodynamic. So, on top of that cap we now put another light steel cap to preserve the aerodynamics of the shell. This all means our battleships have unprecedented armour-piercing power at very long ranges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

alexander_bain;Alexander Bain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alexander_bain_desc;An associate of J.S. Mill, Alexander Bain added connections from physiology to associationist psychology, adding the laws of compound and constructive association to those of contiguity, similarity, and frequency. He was known for writing two of the earliest textbooks in psychology in 1855 and 1859, which were used by later experimental psychologists such as William James. His Spencer–Bain principle concerning probability of behaviour recalls the later Behaviourist school in its conclusions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alfred_adler;Alfred Adler;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alfred_adler_desc;Alfred Adler was an Austrian doctor and psychotherapist. Adler diverged from Freud in arguing that unconscious motivation could be better explained by teleological goals rather than instinctual drives. According to Adler, people are born with a feeling of Inferiority. People attempt to overcome these feelings of inferiority. Adler posited one of three outcomes. An ‘inferiority complex’ develops in people who are overwhelmed by these feelings. Some of these will develop a superiority complex to mask their true feelings. Psychologically healthy people manifest the concept of self-esteem and satisfy their goals through a sense of personal achievement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alfred_binet;Alfred Binet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alfred_binet_desc;Alfred Binet was a French psychologist who pioneered the use of standardized testing to measure individual differences in intelligence. The French government commissioned Binet and his student Theodore Simon to develop a test in 1899 to differentiate ‘retarded’ from ‘normal’ children. The Simon-Binet test divided intelligence into several areas and measured each with a battery of questions. Questions considered to measure higher ability were those answered more often by students whom their teachers had rated highly. Binet also believed that intelligences were inherited, but improvable by education. His test assigned a single ‘mental-level’ score to each subject based on their test results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

alfred_nobel_desc;Alfred Bernhard Nobel was a Swedish chemist, engineer, innovator, and armaments manufacturer. Known for inventing dynamite, Nobel also owned Bofors, which he had redirected from its previous role as primarily an iron and steel producer to a major manufacturer of cannon and other armaments. Nobel held 355 different patents, dynamite being the most famous. After reading a premature obituary which condemned him for profiting from the sales of arms, he bequeathed his fortune to institute the Nobel Prizes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ammunition_production;Ammunition Production;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ammunition_production_desc;The design and production of basic munitions saw much improvement over the course of the 19th century. Advances in weapons design—from muzzle to breech loads to semi-automatics and machine guns—naturally meant that the design and production of ammunition also had to follow suit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amphibious_warfare_training;Amphibious Warfare Training;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amphibious_warfare_training_desc;The experiences of the First World War had demonstrated not only the potential of large-scale amphibious warfare, but also the limitations of current practices and equipment. As such, in the interwar period the major powers worked to increase their capability to launch effective amphibious assaults. These efforts included not only the development of needed equipment, such as purpose-built landing craft, but also the creation and training of land units specializing in amphibious assaults, and the creation of specific naval strategies and tactics to best utilize warships in support and defence of amphibious operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

anatol_rapoport_desc;Anatol Rapoport was a Russian-born American mathematical psychologist. He contributed to general systems theory, mathematical biology and to the mathematical modelling of social interaction and stochastic models of contagion. Rapoport had a versatile mind, working in mathematics, psychology, biology, game theory, social network analysis, and peace and conflict studies. For example, he pioneered in the modelling of parasitism and symbiosis, researching cybernetic theory. This went on to give a conceptual basis for his lifelong work in conflict and cooperation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anna_freud;Anna Freud;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anna_freud_desc;The daughter of Sigmund Freud, Anna began her psychoanalytic practice in 1923. She served as secretary of the International Psychoanalytical Association between 1925 and 1934. Freud became known for her work on the social importance of the ego in childhood development. She wrote ‘The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence’ in which she further developed the concept of defence mechanisms such as repression, displacement, reaction formation and rationalization. These are mental processes to reduce consciousness of wishes, memories and thoughts that prove threatening to self-esteem and security of the individual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

anticlericalism_desc;Anti-clericalism is a historical movement that opposes religious institutional power and influence, real or alleged, in all aspects of public and political life, and the involvement of religion in the everyday life of the citizen. It suggests a more active and partisan role than mere laïcité, and has at times been violent, leading to attacks and seizure of church property.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
antitoxins;Antitoxins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
antitoxins_desc;An Antitoxin is an antibody with the ability to neutralize a specific toxin. Antitoxins are produced by certain animals, plants, and bacteria. Although they are most effective in neutralizing toxins, they can kill bacteria and other microorganisms. Antitoxins are made within organisms, but can be injected into other organisms, including humans. This procedure involves injecting an animal with a safe amount of a particular toxin. Then, the animal’s body makes the antitoxin needed to neutralize the toxin. Later, the blood is withdrawn from the animal. When the antitoxin is obtained from the blood, it is purified and injected into a human or other animal, inducing passive immunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

appeasement;Appeasement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
appeasement_desc;Appeasement in a political context is a diplomatic policy of making political or material concessions to an enemy power in order to avoid conflict. The term is most often applied to the foreign policy of the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain towards Nazi Germany between 1937 and 1939. His policies of avoiding war with Germany have been the subject of intense debate for seventy years among academics, politicians and diplomats. The historians’ assessments have ranged from condemnation for allowing Adolf Hitler’s Germany to grow too strong, to the judgment that he had no alternative and acted in Britain’s best interests. At the time, these concessions were widely seen as positive, and the Munich Pact concluded on 30 September 1938 among Germany, Britain, France, and Italy prompted Chamberlain to announce that he had secured ‘peace for our time’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

art_deco_desc;Art Deco is an influential visual arts design style which first appeared in France during the 1920s, flourished internationally during the 30s and 40s, then waned in the post–World War II era. It is an eclectic style that combines traditional craft motifs with Machine Age imagery and materials. The style is often characterized by rich colours, bold geometric shapes and lavish ornamentation. Deco emerged from the Interwar period when rapid industrialization was transforming culture. One of its major attributes is an embrace of technology. This distinguishes Deco from the organic motifs favoured by its predecessor Art Nouveau.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

auguste_comte;Auguste Comte;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
auguste_comte_desc;Isidore Auguste Marie François Xavier Comte was a French philosopher who founded the political and philosophical movement known as Positivism. He is best known for his six-volume work ‘The Course on Positive Philosophy’ in which he described a law of three stages in the development of the human mind and developed a unifying philosophy of science. Comte’s law was a progressive process. The human mind begins by seeking answers to its questions in theology. Mental development passes through a transition stage to a ‘positive’ or final state, where supernatural or abstract causes are rejected in favour of seeking answers through scientific laws. His accompanying philosophy of science was influential for decades after his death. Within the positivist framework, the interrelation of the various branches of sciences is maintained despite their increasing divergence and level of specialization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Although neglected in his time, the impact of Cournot work on modern economics can hardly be overstated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
autarky;Autarky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
autarky_desc;Derived from the Ancient Greek for self-sufficiency, in the early twentieth century autarky was the goal for many States that felt further dependence upon the global economy was a threat to their national independence or the ideological basis of their regimes. In order to achieve autarky, such states would impose huge tariff barriers to imports from overseas, encourage the development of local industries to produce goods previously imported, strictly regulate foreign trade to preserve national income, and investigate the development of alternative substitutes to critical raw materials that were not available to the nation except from the world market. As an economic policy autarky could be called a twentieth-century revision of mercantilism, and while most often used by Communist and Fascist regimes that rejected all or part the capitalist model of economic production, even capitalist nations would resort to elements of autarky in times of economic instability, especially if they controlled large overseas empires that could provide key raw materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

barbed_wire_defense_desc;Barbed wire is a type of steel fencing wire constructed with sharp edges or points arranged at intervals along the strand. It is used to construct inexpensive fences and is used atop walls or as a major feature of the fortifications in trench warfare, stopping infantry charges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
barbed_wire_desc;Barbed wire was a late-nineteenth century American invention, used originally to keep herds of cattle fenced in. Barbed wire became integrated with the trench systems of World War One as it was relatively easy to string up and often survived artillery bombardments and machine gun fire. The sharp barbs caused injury to attacking infantry. Emplacing rows of barbed wire in front of the trench line gave the machine gunners and field batteries time to decimate an attack while it was stuck cutting the wire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
barrage_fire;Barrage Fire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
barrage_fire_desc;A barrage is massed artillery fire aimed at points, typically 20-30 yards apart, along one or more lines that can be from a few hundred to several thousand yards long. The lines are usually 100 yards apart and fire is lifted from one line to the next and one or several lines may be simultaneously engaged by different firing units. The artillery usually fires at a continuous steady rate, using high explosive or, historically, shrapnel shells. A barrage might be from a few or many batteries, or even from a single gun. Barrage fire may be defensive to deny or hamper enemy passage through an area or offensive to provide covering fire that neutralises the enemy in an area through or towards which friendly forces are advancing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

buying_on_margin;Buying On Margin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
buying_on_margin_desc;As more individuals became involved in investing in securities markets in the early twentieth century, the practice of buying on margin developed to increase the number of shares that could be bought with minimal initial overhead. The principal of buying on margin is that if the investment makes a profit, the profit will cover the cost of the commission charged for allowing the purchase of large amounts of securities with only a minimal initial investment. The risk involved in this type of investment is that if the investment shows a loss, the difference between the initial investment and the commission charged for the purchase must be made up by the investor. How low an initial margin was prudent for the securities industry to accept would be the subject of intense debate, as lower margins both allowed investors with limited capital to invest in markets, but raised the risk of default by these limited-capital investors should the investments fail to produce profits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

canning_process_desc;The canning process was invented after prolonged research by Nicolas Appert of France in 1809, in response to a call by his government for a means of preserving food for army and navy use. Appert’s method consisted of tightly sealing food inside a bottle or jar, heating it to a certain temperature, and maintaining the heat for a certain period, after which the container was kept sealed until use. In 1810 Peter Durand of England patented the use of tin-coated iron cans instead of bottles, and by 1820 he was supplying canned food to the Royal Navy in large quantities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He was influential in developing the concepts of synchronicity, introversion and extraversion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
carl_menger;Carl Menger;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
carl_menger_desc;Carl Menger has been hailed as one of the three leaders of the ‘Marginalist Revolution’ of the 1870s, along with William Stanley Jevons and Léon Walras. However, Menger’s ‘Grundsätze’ (‘Principles’), published in 1871, eschewed all the mathematical scaffolding that characterized the works of the other two revolutionaries. As such, many economists have insisted that Menger should be placed apart. In one sense, he can be considered different. Unlike Jevons or Walras, Carl Menger founded a proper ‘school of thought’ which has more-or-less retained its distinctive character since—namely, the Austrian School. His two disciples at Vienna, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and Friedrich von Wieser did much to advance and forge that school.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

centralized_economic_planning_desc;As more radical ideological alternatives to liberal democracy gained power in the early twentieth century, the opportunity to reconstruct economic organization based on State direction of economic activity that could be compared to the relative success or failure of traditional market-based economic structures arose. Such programs of centralized economic planning, employed by both communist and fascist regimes, often achieved dramatic initial results in reducing unemployment, increasing output of industrial goods, and removing the problem of conflict between labourer and employer in society, which the regimes would trumpet as proof of the superiority of their systems over free market systems. The social and economic costs to these societies, however, were often very high, and the resistance to State control created the potential for brutal repression. However, to the outside world that new little of the negative consequences of these plans, they seemed to suggest a viable alternative to the free-market systems that had been the hallmark of nineteenth century economic theory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

charles_spearman_desc;Charles Spearman was a British psychologist and mathematician. Spearman criticized Galton’s tests as being too simple to measure intelligence. He preferred Binet’s test but criticized the use of a universal number to characterize different areas of intelligence. He developed the process of factor analysis, measuring correlations between performance in different test areas. He proposed two underlying factors ‘g’ for general intelligence to explain the correlations and ‘s’ for specific abilities to explain the imperfections in his correlations. His ‘g’ factor was not a concrete number, but he too believed in the heritability of intelligence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

color_motion_picture;Colour Motion Pictures;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
color_motion_picture_desc;After the advent of motion pictures, a tremendous amount of energy was invested in the production of photography in natural colour. Early movies were not actually colour movies, since they were shot monochrome and hand-coloured or machine-coloured afterwards. In 1902, Edward Raymond Turner produced first films with natural colour process rather than using colorization techniques. In 1908, Kinemacolor was introduced. In the same year, A Visit to the Seaside, a short film became the first natural colour movie to be publicly presented. In 1917 Technicolor was introduced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

combine_harvesters;Combine Harvesters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
combine_harvesters_desc;The Combine Harvester, or simply Combine, is a versatile machine designed to efficiently harvest a variety of grain crops. The name derives from its combining three separate harvesting operations—reaping, threshing, and winnowing—into a single process. With the use of a steam engine in a combine harvester, the potential harvest of a single worker increases dramatically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
combined_arms_planning;Combined Arms Planning;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
combined_arms_planning_desc;In the aftermath of the First World War, the major powers put an increasing emphasis on what came to be known as combined operations. This represented the utilization of land, sea, and air forces together to achieve a single strategic objective. Often revolving around amphibious operations, combined operations often fit within larger naval strategic objectives, including the destruction of enemy naval assets and the securing of sea-lanes. No longer could navies operate in isolation from the other branches of the military, and the development of new tactics was required to integrate naval warfare into the larger strategic perspective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

conveyor_belt;Conveyor Belt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
conveyor_belt_desc;The conveyor belt consisted of two pulleys with a continuous loop of material, powered by a motor transmission. The engineering firm Sandvik of Sweden was producing steel conveyor belts by 1891. Thomas Robins developed a conveyor belt that replaced expensive steel with rubber. In 1905, Thomas Sutcliffe patented the first conveyor belt for use underground. The conveyor belt made it easy to transport ores out of the mines, and was soon adopted by Henry Ford in his new assembly line factories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
convoy_sailing;Convoy Sailing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
convoy_sailing_desc;Traditionally in wartime, merchant shipping had continued to sail individually and without escort, in the belief that the most effective way of defending merchant shipping was through the use of squadrons hunting down enemy raiders.

cotton_gin_desc;The Cotton Gin is a machine for cleaning cotton of its seeds. The device pulls the cotton through a set of wire teeth mounted on a revolving cylinder, the fibre passing through narrow slots in an iron breastwork too small to permit passage of the seed. The simplicity of the invention—which could be powered by man, animal, or water—caused it to be widely copied despite patents. The cotton gin increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor of 50. While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fibre from the seeds, a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

david_hume;David Hume;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
david_hume_desc;David Hume was a Scottish philosopher, historian and essayist, highly influential in the fields of empiricism and scepticism. Hume argued in ‘A Treatise of Human Nature’ that the psychological basis for human behaviour was desire rather than reason. He rejected the views of Locke that humans were born with innate ideas, believing instead that knowledge is derived solely from direct experience. Hume wrote that moral actions came from passions and were intrinsically motivated, rather than derived from Reason. He believed in the compatibility of scientific determinism with the concept of free will. The exercise of liberty in fact requires the uniform physical laws governing the natural world, or else our exercise of free will would be nothing more than an act of chance. Hume influenced a diverse group of contemporary and subsequent writers including William James, Adam Smith and Kant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

early_archaeology;Early Archaeology;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
early_archaeology_desc;Archaeology is the study of the activity of ancient civilizations, primarily through the recovery and analysis of the objects and records left behind, including artefacts, architecture, biofacts and cultural landscapes. Organized study of human antiquity dates back to the days of the Renaissance, but in the 19th century archaeology evolved into a true science. Archaeologists began to investigate various ruins around the world, with the study of ancient Aegean civilization being stimulated by the excavations of Heinrich Schliemann at Troy and of Arthur Evans at Crete, while John Lloyd Stephens was a pivotal figure in the rediscovery of the Maya civilization throughout Central America. However, the methodologies employed by these early archaeologists were problematic by the standards of the 20th century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

early_electrical_telegraph_desc;The first commercial electrical telegraph was co-developed by Sir William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone. This was a five-needle, six-wire system. The cables were originally installed underground in a steel conduit. However, the cables soon began to fail as a result of deteriorating insulation and were replaced with uninsulated wires on poles. As an interim measure, a two-needle system was used with three of the remaining working underground wires, which despite using only two needles had a greater number of codes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ec_tolman_desc;Edward C. Tolman was another prominent American psychologist in the field of behaviourism. Tolman performed maze experiments to demonstrate latent learning in animals. He showed that a rat could run the maze on the first try, if it was previously allowed to explore the maze while not hungry. Tolman evinced that the subject learned useful stimulus information about the world without reference to a reinforcing stimulus. The ability to run the maze correctly on trial one demonstrated flexibility in the use of the learned information. Tolman’s stimulus–stimulus learning was opposed by the stimulus–response orthodoxy of Skinner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

eduard_bernstein_desc;Eduard Bernstein was originally a staunch disciple of Marx and started his life in the German Social-democratic Party, but during his later exile in London Bernstein gradually became convinced that the best way to obtain socialism in an industrialized country was through trade union activity and parliamentary politics. He published a series of articles where he argued that the predictions made by Karl Marx about the development of capitalism had not come true. He pointed out that the real wages of workers had risen and the polarization of classes between an oppressed proletariat and capitalist, had not materialized. Nor had capital become concentrated in fewer hands. Bernstein’s revisionist views appeared in his extremely influential book ‘Evolutionary Socialism’ (1899).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

edward_titchener_desc;Edward Titchener was an English psychologist who studied under Wundt at Leipzig. Titchener headed the psychology department at Cornell University and founded the Structuralist school, which relied heavily on introspection to perform analysis on the structure of the mind. His attempts to break down experiences into four basic elements was discredited because it was possible for different subjects to identify different elements from the same experiences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

el_thorndike;Edward L. Thorndike;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
el_thorndike_desc;Edward Lee Thorndike was an American researcher who also conducted experiments in animal learning. He was known for his puzzle-box procedure, in which a hungry cat was placed inside a small cage and observed to see how long it took the cat to learn to pull the lever and escape, where food was waiting. He observed that after 20-30 trials, the cats had become efficient at escaping almost instantaneously. Thorndike formulated the law of effect, stating that responses producing a positive effect became more likely to occur again, and those producing discomfort were less likely to occur again. These observations were later transformed by B.F. Skinner into the concept of operant conditioning in psychology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

electrolytic_refining_desc;Electrolysis, or electrolytic refining, is a technique used for extraction, as well as purification, of metals obtained by any refining method. In the electro-refining process, a block of impure metal becomes the anode, and a thin sheet of metal becomes the cathode. Both the cathode and anode are dipped in an electrolytic cell containing an aqueous solution of the metal salt. Upon the application of electric current of a suitable voltage, pure metal is deposited at the cathode by the dissolution of impure metal at the anode.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

epic_theatre_desc;Epic theatre was a theatrical movement arising in the early to mid-20th century from the theories and practice of a number of theatre practitioners, including Erwin Piscator, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Vsevolod Meyerhold and, most famously, Bertolt Brecht. The term epic theatre comes from Erwin Piscator who coined it during his first year as Director of Berlin’s Volksbühne. Although many of the concepts and practices involved in Brechtian epic theatre had been around for years, even centuries, Brecht unified them, developed the style, and popularized it. Epic theatre incorporates a mode of acting that utilises what he calls gestus. The epic form describes both a type of written drama and a methodological approach to the production of plays.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
erich_fromm;Erich Fromm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
erich_fromm_desc;Erich Fromm was a German social psychologist, psychoanalyst, sociologist, humanistic philosopher, and democratic socialist. He was associated with the Frankfurt School of critical theory. Fromm’s best-known work, ‘Escape from Freedom’, focuses on the human urge to seek a source of authority and control upon reaching a freedom that was thought to be an individual’s true desire. Fromm’s critique of the modern political order and capitalist system led him to seek insights from medieval feudalism. In Escape from Freedom, he found favour with the lack of individual freedom, rigid structure, and obligations required on the members of medieval society. The culmination of Fromm’s social and political philosophy was his book ‘The Sane Society’, published in 1955, which argued in favour of a humanistic and democratic socialism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

eugen_von_bohm_bawerk;Eugen Böhm von Bawerk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
eugen_von_bohm_bawerk_desc;Böhm-Bawerk’s career as a scholar was an intermittent one. The most significant span of scholarly activity was his years at the University of Innsbruck. It was during the 1880s that he first published two of the three volumes of his magnum opus, ‘Capital and Interest’. His later years were dominated by his duties as the Austrian Minister of Finance, a position he held, though not continuously, throughout the 1890s and beyond—and for which he is fittingly honoured by having his likeness on Austria’s one—hundred schillings note. After serving in this capacity and assuming other governmental duties, he returned to teaching in 1904. With a chair at the University of Vienna, he became a colleague of Wieser, successor to the retired Menger. Students who passed through the university during the last decade of Böhm-Bawerk’s career included Joseph Schumpeter and Ludwig von Mises.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
eugenics;Eugenics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
eugenics_desc;An outgrowth from Darwinist ideas on natural selection and trait theories and from the studies in intelligence measurement, Eugenics was concerned with the mental and physical traits found in society and a response to the weaknesses found. Positive eugenics encouraged family programs, social welfare, and the importance of education in the desirability of breeding to increase the appearance of positive traits. Negative eugenics argued for the need to remove weak traits by removing undesirable elements, leading to sterilization and even extermination of target groups.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
existentialism;Existentialism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
existentialism_desc;Existentialism has many mothers. In one way it could be interpreted as a radical individualism traced from Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, but it is more. It is also the notion of the given as not really given but only meaningful through the process of interpretation, something that it got from Husserl, and more indirectly from Bretano. However, it was taken further by Heidegger and later Sartre, Beauvoir, and Camus, and became focused on what gives meaning to the person, where the person should be understood as a being that is free to take action and thus create their own meaning rather than the more inflexible, outdated cartesian ideal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

firepower_vs_mobility_desc;After the end of the First World War, the major powers had to re-evaluate their military strategies in light of the brutal lessons learned during the years of inconclusive trench warfare. One major school of thought that emerged focussed on the importance of using massed firepower, principally in the form of artillery, to overwhelm the enemy and literally blast a hole in their lines to facilitate an advance, while another school of thought suggested that the key to victory on the modern battlefield was mobility, so that friendly forces could manoeuvre around enemy strongpoints to pursue the attack on more advantageous terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fischer_tropsch_process_desc;The Fischer–Tropsch process was developed at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Kohlenforschung in 1925 by German chemists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch. The Fischer–Tropsch process indirectly produces synthetic oils and fuels via a series of reactions. Coal or Natural Gas is converted to a gaseous state, and then reacts with a mixture of Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen to produce various hydrocarbon products. Nazi Germany used this process extensively in the Second World War to convert their abundant coal stocks into replacement fuels after they were cut off from most natural sources of oil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fish_trawlers_desc;The modern fishing trawler was developed in the 19th century, at the English fishing port of Brixham. By the early 19th century, the fishermen at Brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the overfished waters of South Devon. The Brixham trawler that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall gaff rig, which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean. They were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water. The great trawling fleet that built up at Brixham, earned the village the title of ‘Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fractional_distillation_desc;Fractional Distillation is a process of separating crude oil into various fractions of hydrocarbons. The Crude Oil is heated to a temperature between 350 and 370 degrees Celsius which causes vaporization. The gas is then fed into a fractional distillation column, which is made up of several trays and outflowing channels. As the vapour rises, it cools according to its boiling point. The fractions with high boiling points condense into the lower trays.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

francis_galton_desc;Sir Francis Galton was a British aristocrat who wrote extensively on the measurement of an individual’s mental abilities using sensory and motor tests. His 1869 work ‘Hereditary Genius: An Inquiry into its Laws and Consequences’ argued that the children of geniuses tended to become geniuses themselves. He surveyed thousands of fellow academics, publishing in 1874 his findings that intelligence was primarily a heritable trait, although there was some necessity for environmental nurturance of that trait. He was the first to use identical and fraternal twins to measure the effects of nature versus nurture, and established in 1888 the theoretical basis for correlation, scatterplots, and regression as measurement tools.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

frankfurt_school;Frankfurt School;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
frankfurt_school_desc;The Frankfurt School is a school of social theory and philosophy associated in part with the Institute for Social Research at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. The school initially formed during the interwar period in Germany and consisted of dissidents who were at home neither in the existent capitalist, fascist nor communist systems that had formed during the interwar period. Meanwhile, many of these theorists believed that traditional theory could not adequately explain the turbulent and unexpected development of capitalist societies in the twentieth century. Critical of both capitalism and Soviet socialism, their writings pointed to the possibility of an alternative path to social development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He is best known for his theories on the unconscious mind and the mechanism of repression, and for creating the clinical method of psychoanalysis for investigating the mind and treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Freud established sexual drives as the primary motivational forces of human life, developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association, discovered the phenomenon of transference in the therapeutic relationship and established its central role in the analytic process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
friction_hoist;Friction Hoist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
friction_hoist_desc;Invented in 1877 by Frederick Koepe, friction (or Koepe) hoists are mounted on the ground above the mine shaft, or at the top of the headframe. They utilize tail ropes and counterweights and do not have the haulage rope fixed to the wheel, but instead passed around it. The tail-ropes and weights offset the need for the motor to overcome the weight of the conveyance and hoisting rope, thereby reducing the required horsepower of the hoisting motor by up to 30%, with the overall power consumption remaining the same. Friction hoists, unlike drum hoists, can and normally do use multiple ropes giving them a larger payload capacity, however since they require a larger safety factor, they are impractical for very deep shafts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
friedrich_engels;Friedrich Engels;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
friedrich_engels_desc;As a young man Engels went to Manchester to help his father manage his cotton factory. Engels was shocked by the poverty in the city and began writing an account that was published as ‘Condition of the Working Classes in England’ (1844). Here Engels met Marx with whom he would write and try to organize the international worker organizations for the rest of his life. Engels lived in the shadows of Marx’s intellectually, but economically he financed Marx so that he could write. Basically, there wouldn’t have been a Marx without an Engels and vice versa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
friedrich_hayek;Friedrich Hayek;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
friedrich_hayek_desc;An Austrian economist who would challenge the influence of Keynesian economics upon the actions of the State in the 1930s and attach the planned economic models inherent in both socialist and fascist political models increasingly in vogue in the era. Much like his teacher Ludwig von Mises, Hayek attacked Keynesian economic prescriptions for dealing with economic downturns as causing more potential problems than solutions by creating conditions for inflation by raising demand more rapidly than supply could meet. Hayek rejected the idea of central planning in the marketplace as highly inefficient in its ability to produce the supply and quality of goods that would be generated by consumer demand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
friedrich_list;Friedrich List;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
friedrich_list_desc;Friedrich List was a nationalist and romantic critic of economic theory and one of the forefathers of the German Historical School. His best-known work, ‘The National System of Political Economy’ (1841) was written as against the free-trade doctrines that permeated Classical economics. However, his was not a polemical defence of protectionism. He argued it on the basis of his analysis of economics, which stressed political factors—notably, the ‘nation’—in economics. List argued that it was the government’s responsibility to foster the ‘productive powers’ of a nation and, once these were in place, then free trade could ensue, but not before. This is akin to the modern ‘infant industry’ argument for protection. More relevantly, he developed a theory of economic ‘stages’ which was to serve as a blueprint for the German Historical School.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

froth_flotation_desc;Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic. This is used in mineral processing, paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century. It has been described as ‘the single most important operation used for the recovery and upgrading of sulphide ores’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

futurism_desc;As the questioning of the values and structures of the Victorian era gained momentum in intellectual circles in the early twentieth century, some intellectuals began to argue that a clean break with the past was needed in order to build a brilliant new future that the rise of industrial civilization had promised. Beginning as a movement within the arts that embraced new materials and stylistic techniques that attempted to capture the essence of material power and speed, Futurism would soon spread as an idea to challenge conventional structures of society and call for their replacement with a new social, political and economic order that embraced the reality of industrial society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

germ_theory_desc;The germ theory of disease states that some diseases are caused by microorganisms. These small organisms, too small to see without magnification, invade humans, animals, and other living hosts. Their growth and reproduction within their hosts can cause a disease. The germ theory was proposed in the mid-16th century and gained widespread credence when substantiated by scientific discoveries of the 17th through the late 19th century. It supplanted earlier explanations for disease, such as Galen’s miasma theory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

globalized_markets_desc;Globalization is the process of international integration arising from the interchange of world views, products, ideas and other aspects of culture. Advances in transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, including the rise of the telegraph and its posterity the Internet, are major factors in globalization, generating further interdependence of economic and cultural activities. Though scholars place the origins of globalization in modern times, others trace its history long before the European age of discovery and voyages to the New World. Large-scale globalization began in the 19th century and in the late 19th century and early 20th century, the connectedness of the world’s economies and cultures grew very quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

gustav_von_schmoller;Gustav von Schmoller;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gustav_von_schmoller_desc;Schmoller’s opposition to Neoclassical economics entered him into a famous methodological debate (Methodenstreit) with Carl Menger. Although many argue that he lost the debate by the simple fact of non-engagement (it is reported that upon receiving Menger’s Investigations, he returned it unread to its author and published a ‘semi-review’ of it claiming that, indeed, it had not even been worth reading), Schmoller nonetheless retained his grip on the German university appointment system and kept Classical and Neoclassical economic theory largely out of German teaching—earning him the eternal enmity of the only potential challenger at the time, Menger’s Austrian School. Gustav Schmoller’s political involvements were also important, in 1872, he formed the Verein für Sozialpolitik, (‘Society for Social Policy’), a group of largely conservative economists which supported a kind of corporatist state-industry-labour nexus. Liberals deplored their advocacy for state interventionism and came to label Schmoller and the Historicists as Kathedersozialisten (or ‘Socialists of the Chair’)—a jest they never entirely lived down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Its main tenants were the philosophical view that the mind or spirit constitutes the fundamental reality which draw history onwards in a semi-deterministic fashion. His influence cannot be underestimated, among his disciples was the young Karl Marx who further developed this type of idealism though into a different direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

human_resource_development;Human Resource Development;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
human_resource_development_desc;A theory of production management developed from the work of Elton Mayo based on research into productivity conducted at the Hawthorne Works in Chicago in the United States in the 1920s. Challenging the theories of Scientific Management, the Hawthorne Studies, and the interpretation of the data provided by Mayo, a more ‘human-centred’ approach to worker management as the key to improved productivity was developed. By making workers feel they were a valued part of the production process and not simply ‘cogs in the machine’ productivity would increase. While the analysis of the data was disputed by many researchers, the arguments gained influence as the twentieth century evolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

humanistic_psychology;Humanistic Psychology;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
humanistic_psychology_desc;Humanistic psychology was developed in the 1950s in reaction to both behaviourism and psychoanalysis. By using phenomenology, intersubjectivity, and first-person categories, the humanistic approach sought to glimpse the whole person—not just the fragmented parts of the personality or cognitive functioning. Humanism focused on fundamentally and uniquely human issues, such as individual free will, personal growth, self-actualization, self-identity, death, aloneness, freedom, and meaning. The humanistic approach was distinguished by its emphasis on subjective meaning, rejection of determinism, and concern for positive growth rather than pathology. Some founders of the humanistic school of thought were American psychologists Abraham Maslow, who formulated a hierarchy of human needs, and Carl Rogers, who created and developed client-centred therapy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hydraulic_excavator_desc;The very first excavator to use hydraulic technology was built in 1882 by Sir W. G. Armstrong & Company in England, where it was used in construction of the Hull docks. Unlike later excavators that use hydraulic fluid, water was used to operate the hydraulic functions. Also, it was not a true hydraulic machine, but a hybrid that used cables to operate the bucket but with a hydraulic cylinder operating a set of multiplying sheaves. The idea was not successful, neither on this machine nor on a machine of somewhat similar design built by the unrelated Frank F. Armstrong for Penn Iron Mining Company in the United States in 1914.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hyperinflation;Hyperinflation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hyperinflation_desc;For many nations, the socioeconomic strains caused by involvement in wars with other industrial nations resulted in huge deficits that made it impossible to return immediately to the gold standard. Some nations, facing new demands upon their incomes as a result of new social obligations to those involved in recent wars or obligations for being on the losing side of wars, found the demands too great, and sought to resolve their problems by expanding the amount of currency of circulation. With nothing to guarantee the value of the currency, the result would be to rapidly depreciate the value of the currency relative to other currencies or materials such as gold. The social impact of such government policies was traumatic, especially for those who lived on limited or fixed incomes or those who had investments denominated in the rapidly depreciating currency. To many, the willingness of the State to engage in such activity, and the market reaction to such activities, would lead to a search for alternative ideologies to restore order and stability in society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hypodermic_injection;Hypodermic Injections;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hypodermic_injection_desc;In the 1840s physicians interested in safe ways to administer small amounts of potent medications such as opiates and strychnine experimented with injection through the skin using hollow needles. Doctors found that an injection beneath the skin anywhere on a patient’s body could produce effects elsewhere, as the blood carried the medication throughout the body. Syringes with glass walls were soon developed, so that the amount of liquid within the syringe could be seen from the outside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
i_analytic_philosophy;Analytic Philosophy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
i_analytic_philosophy_desc;This was originally a disparate movement of philosophers who wanted to free logics and the foundation of mathematics from elder defunct and inconsistent thesis. It later developed into trying to bridge language and formal logics and thus create an objective realist ground for reality. This took a side path into logical positivism. However, the objectivist position crashed as one of its early protégés Ludwig Wittgenstein took a 90 degree turn and tried to refute his own earlier position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

i_empiricism_desc;In its strong form, it is the thesis that there is no reality behind appearances. A weaker form of empiricism admits of the existence of a reality which is, however, trans-empirical. The transcendent nature of reality determines that we can have no knowledge of it and thus must simply catalogue the formal relations between appearances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
i_scientific_management;Scientific Management;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
i_scientific_management_desc;A theory of production management developed by Frederick William Taylor in 1911 that asserted that worker productivity could be maximized by optimizing different tasks to those workers who are best able to perform those tasks. In combination with the provision of break times to workers to break the monotony of the daily work routine, Taylor’s theories of worker management and ‘fitting the worker to the job’ would come to be embraced as a basic tenet to maintaining and expanding production. However, one limit to Taylorism was its emphasis of the worker as simply part of the production process and as the twentieth century evolved some commentators came to see Taylor’s approach to worker management as a cause of increased interest in labour unions and socialism among the working class.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

immanuel_kant_desc;Immanuel Kant was a German philosopher, highly influential in many fields such as metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, and political philosophy. He promoted as a central theme of the Enlightenment the application of reason to subjective experiences in order to derive knowledge. Kant published ‘The Critique of Pure Reason’ in which he argued for a ‘Copernican revolution’ in philosophy. Kant’s doctrine became known as Transcendental Idealism. Kant believed that humans do not experience the world in a direct way, but in a phenomenal way using our senses. These experiences are thus purely subjective and incapable of comprehension as they are until processed through Reason. He stated that concepts of mathematics, space and time were transcendental. That is, they were necessary preconditions for the possibilities of experience. His theories influenced a wide spectrum of thinkers and scientists within many disciplines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

import_substitution_industrialization_2_desc;The growth of the global economy in the nineteenth and early twentieth century resulted in increased demand for industrial goods by non-Western societies. However, the realities of war in the industrial age and increasing economic instability of periods of expansion and contraction resulted in non-Western societies at times being unable to meet their needs for industrial goods from the traditional producers of such goods in the West. As a result, an opening for producers in non-Western societies to meet the demand for those industrial goods that could not be acquired easily from the West arose, and industrialization in the non-Western world began to grow. Eventually pressure to protect these new industries from competition from overseas would lead some nations which had maintained political independence to adopt policies of import substitution industrialization to encourage their societies to break their dependence upon the West for industrial goods and, by extension, strengthen their own societies in the global economic system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

By the 19th century, unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to rough pasture in mountainous areas and in relatively small parts of the lowlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

indirect_fire_techniques;Indirect Fire Techniques;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
indirect_fire_techniques_desc;Indirect fire involves aiming and firing artillery projectiles on targets not in a direct line of sight. The degree of accuracy achieved is dependent on calculations of the azimuth and firing elevation of the gun. The first practical manual was written in 1882 by a Russian officer, K.G. Guk. Guk described how to fix aiming points for firing arcs using geometry. The lack of a device to measure azimuth was solved in 1890 when Germany introduced the lining-plane. The lining-plane was mounted in-line with the bore and enabled the measurement of large angles. The effectiveness of indirect fire increased greatly with actual battlefield experience in the First World War. The introduction of airborne spotters in balloons and aircraft allowed for gun crews to correct their firing calculations during battles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

industrial_farming_desc;The notion of a farm being the province of a single family or landowner is slowly becoming a thing of the past.

industrial_furniture_production;Industrial Furniture Production;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
industrial_furniture_production_desc;Where previously carpenters and joiners had made furniture along with every kind of building construction in wood, several circumstances combined to create a new profession: that of the cabinetmaker. The growth of cabinetmaking as a trade of its own eventually resulted in a considerable degree of standardization of methods of construction, particularly in the types of joints used and in the thicknesses of wood for the various parts. It also resulted in an increased division of labour: turners, carvers, chairmakers, upholsterers all worked in their respective roles to make and assemble furniture. In the new system of construction, plain, flat parts are dovetailed together and then veneered. It can be contrasted with the traditional framed method of rails and stiles put together with mortise and tenon joints, the panels fitting in grooves. A large store often retained its own workshops where special items were made to customers’ requirements, but for the greater part it became the practice to buy wholesale from furniture making firms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

industrial_luxury_furniture_production_desc;Marquetry is the centrepiece of the decorative use of the grain and colour of wood in surfaces unbroken by panelling for luxury furniture. To produce the desired effect, the ébéniste, or specialist in marquetry, either drew the pattern directly on the base wood or affixed a paper pattern onto the wood. The thin sheets were then cut out with a burin or, later, sometimes with a saw, the pattern assembled and glued onto the carcass. Marquetry patterns became more and more complex and, though often floral, they could also include geometric and narrative subjects. The range of materials used also became more varied, including not only rare tropical woods and metals such as silver, bronze, and brass but also a wide range of other materials of a semiprecious nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
industrial_paper_production;Continuous Paper-Making Machines;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
industrial_paper_production_desc;Before the invention of continuous paper making, paper was made in individual sheets by stirring a container of pulp slurry and either pouring it into a fabric sieve called a sheet mould or dipping and lifting the sheet mould from the vat. While still on the fabric in the sheet mould, the wet paper was pressed to remove excess water. The sheet was then lifted off to be hung over a rope or wooden rod to air dry. The Fourdrinier machine, the first continuous one, changed all that. It uses a specially woven fabric mesh conveyor belt in the forming section, where a slurry of fibre is drained to create a continuous paper web, with paper left in a horizontal drainage area, referred to as the drainage table.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

irving_fischer_desc;Irving Fisher was one of the earliest American Neoclassicals of unusual mathematical sophistication. He made numerous important contributions to the Neoclassical Marginalist Revolution. This Yale economist was an eccentric and colourful figure. When Irving Fisher wrote his 1892 dissertation, he constructed a remarkable machine equipped with pumps, wheels, levers and pipes in order to illustrate his price theory—see here for pictures of his draft and his first and second prototypes. Socially, he was an avid advocate of eugenics and health food diets. He made a fortune with his visible index card system—known today as the rolodex—and advocated the establishment of a 100 percent reserve requirement banking system. His fortune was lost and his reputation was severely marred by the 1929 Wall Street Crash, when just days before the crash, he was reassuring investors that stock prices were not overinflated but, rather, had achieved a new, permanent plateau.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In the course of studies with dogs and salivation, Pavlov observed that the dogs elicited a certain type of salivation with certain signals that preceded the arrival of food. In his 1927 study, Pavlov laid out the basic principles of classical conditioning in Behaviourism. The food was the unconditioned stimulus for salivation. The signal became associated with salivation as a conditioned stimulus, with salivation to the sound of the signal alone becoming the new conditioned response. Extinction, recovery, generalization and discrimination were identified in subsequent studies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Its blend of frenetic, intoxicating rhythms, powerful melodies which encouraged improvisation by performers to add their own distinctive touches to each performance, and energetic vocals would hit upon the world just as new technologies to spread new music, such as the phonograph record, radio and sound cinema, provided a platform to showcase it to a worldwide audience. In the 1920s it became one of the dominant forms of popular music in the world, though many of the traditional arbiters of taste frowned upon its popularity as further proof that society was rebelling against proper authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jb_watson;John B. Watson;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jb_watson_desc;John Broadus Watson was an American psychologist who studied Pavlovian conditioning in humans. Watson’s most famous experiment involved conditioning an 11-year old child named Albert to associate a conditioned stimulus to an unconditioned stimulus. Watson’s research later led to clinical treatments extinguishing irrational fears in people. After being dismissed from Harvard over an affair and marriage with a graduate student, Watson brought his research experience to a prominent advertising firm. Modern advertising owed much to behaviourist psychology and conditioning concepts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

While out of parliament Jaurès completed his mammoth Socialist History of the French Revolution. He also joined with Aristide Briand and Rene Viviani in 1904 to establish the left-wing newspaper L’Humanité in 1904. A new Socialist Party under Jaurès grew rapidly at the beginning of the century but split over the correct response to German militarism.

Although educated at Göttingen, he spent most of his life managing his rural estate, Tellow. In the first volume of his treatise, ‘The Isolated State’, he laid down the first serious treatment of spatial economics, connecting with the theory of rent. His second volume developed the essence of the marginal productivity theory of distribution in a mathematically precise way, thereby making one of the most important Proto-Marginalists of the era. Nearing his death, he asked that his famous equation for the marginal product of labour, or natural wage, be carved into his tombstone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

john_maynard_keynes;John Maynard Keynes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
john_maynard_keynes_desc;An English economist who challenged the orthodox view of the role of the State in the management of economic forces in society and the relationship between supply and demand in times of economic crisis. Drawing upon the abilities of states to mobilize their economies during wars with other industrial nations, Keynes maintained that the State could use its influence to promote more efficient economic development. But his most radical theory involved the role of aggregate demand in the economy, arguing that it was demand, not supply, that was the final determinant in the levels of output and growth that an economy could produce, and that in times of economic slowdown or crisis, the solution to the crisis involved revival of demand to absorb excess supply and create the conditions for a revival of production to meet further increases in demand. While his theories had many critics, they became highly influential as the twentieth century progressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
john_ramsay_mcculloch;John Ramsay McCulloch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
john_ramsay_mcculloch_desc;A prolific Scottish journalist, John Ramsay McCulloch was one of the most ardent and doctrinaire expositors of the Classical Ricardian School. McCulloch began his career as the editor of The Scotsman, eventually moving on to the whiggish Edinburgh Review, where he served as economics editor until the late 1830s. McCulloch used his position at the Review to popularize the Classical theories and promote his favourite economic policies, such as the repeal of the Corn Laws, the retention of the Poor Laws and the legalization of trade unions. McCulloch also lectured on political economy at University College London from 1828 to 1832. In 1838, he was appointed the Comptroller of HM Stationary Office. McCulloch’s main work, ‘Principles’ (1825), was perhaps the first successful ‘serious’ textbook in economics (and a rather loyal reading of Ricardo’s theory). However, McCulloch is often considered a ‘lightweight’ in terms of the development of economic theory. His main contribution was the ill-fated ‘wages fund’ doctrine (1824,1825, 1826). McCulloch was also the editor of the 1828 edition of Adam Smith’s ‘Wealth of Nations’ and the 1846 edition of David Ricardo’s works. He also composed some of the earliest accounts of the history of economic thought (naturally, flattering to the Ricardians). His monumental 1837 treatise provides a statistical account of the failure of the Malthusian population doctrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

joseph_schumpeter_desc;After a quick doctorate at Vienna, Schumpeter roamed about as something of a footloose lawyer until he re-joined academia in 1909. It was while he was teaching at Czernowitz (now in the Ukraine) that he wrote his Theory of Economic Development (1911), where he first outlined his famous theory of entrepreneurship. He argued those daring spirits, entrepreneurs, created technical and financial innovations in the face of competition and falling profits—and that it was these spurts of activity which generated (irregular) economic growth. In 1919, Schumpeter became the Austrian Minister of Finance—unfortunately, presiding over the hyperinflation of the period, and thus was dismissed later that year. Although excelling as a teacher above everything, Joseph Schumpeter nonetheless completed three more books while at Harvard: his didactic Business Cycles (1939), his popular Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy(1942)—in which he famously predicted the downfall of capitalism in the hands of intellectuals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jung_desc;Carl Gustav Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist, an influential thinker, and the founder of analytical psychology. Jung is often considered the first modern psychologist to state that the human psyche is ‘by nature religious’ and to explore it in depth. Those not the first to analyse dreams, he has become perhaps one of the most well-known pioneers in the field of dream analysis. Unlike Freud, he was a self-described natural scientist and not a theoretical psychologist. For Jung this salient distinction revolved around his initial process of deep observation followed by categorizations rather than the reverse process of imagining what categories exist and then proceeding to seek for proof of and then discover that one was correct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

karl_marx_desc;Karl Marx was originally disciple of Hegel, but evolved his idealistic philosophy. Later in Paris he began mixing with members of the working class for the first time. Marx was shocked by their poverty but impressed by their sense of comradeship. In an article that he wrote for the Franco-German Annals, Marx applied Hegel’s dialectic theory to what he had observed in Paris. Marx, who now described himself as a communist, argued that the working class (the proletariat), would eventually be the emancipators of society. Marx’ most influential works were, The German Ideology, The Communist Manifesto, Principles of Communism, and Das Kapital. For most of his life he lived in England where he published his works and from where he became the most influential socialist of all time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

knut_wicksell;Knut Wicksell;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
knut_wicksell_desc;He was a Swedish economist whose work led to the widespread use of the word ‘natural’ to explain the long-run equilibrium rate of interest. Wicksell had a tremendous influence on economist James M. Buchanan. According to Buchanan, his theory of public choice ‘was an almost natural consequence of my absorption of the Wicksellian message’, which stated that economists must cease acting as if government were a benevolent despot. Wicksell was a Malthusian and a strong advocate of birth control. He spoke out on moral issues quite often. He is best known for his work in ‘Interest and Prices’, in which he laid out his version of the quantity theory of money. His version was different from the standard view at that time in that he looked at the indirect effect that the money supply has on prices. Wicksell also elaborated on the theory of marginal productivity, which states that the payment to each factor of production equals that factors marginal productivity. He also stated that an efficient allocation of resources does not guarantee equitable distribution, because the pre-existing distribution of income determines what form this allocation will take, and the pre-existing distribution of income is not always just. The Stockholm School developed its own version of macroeconomics, which was based on Wicksell’s work on quantity and price theory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lancashire_loom;Lancashire Power Loom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lancashire_loom_desc;The Lancashire Loom is a self-acting loom, though it has to be stopped to recharge empty shuttles. The principal advantage of the Lancashire loom was that it was semi-automatic, when a warp thread broke the weaver was notified. When the shuttle ran out of thread, the machine stopped. An operative thus could work 4 or more looms whereas previously they could only work a single loom. Indeed, the term A Four Loom Weaver was used to describe the operatives. Labour cost was quartered. In some mills an operative would operate 6 or even 8 looms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

leon_walras;Léon Walras;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
leon_walras_desc;The French economist Léon Walras has been hailed by Joseph Schumpeter as ‘the greatest of all economists’. Walras was one of the three leaders of the Marginalist Revolution, even though his greatest work, ‘Elements of Pure Economics’, was published in 1874, three years after those of William Stanley Jevons and Carl Menger. Nonetheless, alone among the three revolutionaries, Léon Walras set forth the new ‘marginalist’ or ‘Neoclassical’ theory in a formal general equilibrium setting. Thus, he endowed it with the multi-market considerations Jevons had largely avoided and the mathematical precision Menger had eschewed. Léon Walras is widely and rightfully regarded as the father of general equilibrium theory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It first saw very limited action in the American Civil War it was subsequently improved and used in the Franco-Prussian war and North-West Rebellion. Many were sold to other armies in the late 19th century and continued to be used into the early 20th century. The first self-powered machine gun was invented in 1885 by Sir Hiram Maxim. The ‘Maxim gun’ used the recoil power of the previously fired bullet to reload rather than being hand-powered, enabling a much higher rate of fire than was possible using earlier designs such as the Nordenfelt and Gatling weapons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

mackinder_and_the_heartland_theory_desc;"Mackinder’s Heartland Theory hypothesized a huge empire being brought into existence in the Heartland—which wouldn’t need to use coastal or transoceanic transport to remain coherent. The basic notions of Mackinder’s doctrine involve considering the geography of the Earth as being divided into two sections: The World Island, comprising Eurasia and Africa; and the Peripheral ‘islands’, including the Americas, Australia, Japan, the British Isles, and Oceania. Mackinder’s notion of geopolitics was summed up when he said: ‘Who rules Central and Eastern Europe commands the Heartland. Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island. Who rules the World-Island commands the World’. His doctrine was influential during the World Wars and the Cold War, as Germany and later Russia each made territorial strides toward the ‘Heartland’.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mahatma_gandhi;Mahatma Gandhi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mahatma_gandhi_desc;Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was the preeminent leader of Indian independence movement in British-ruled India. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. Gandhi famously led Indians in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km Dandi Salt March in 1930, and later in calling for the British to Quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned for many years, upon many occasions, in both South Africa and India. Gandhi attempted to practise nonviolence and truth in all situations, and advocated that others do the same. He lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn hand spun on a charkha. He ate simple vegetarian food, and also undertook long fasts as a means to both self-purification and social protest. Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948 by firing three bullets into his chest at point-blank range.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

marxism_leninism_desc;Marxism–Leninism was a further development of the Marxist theory described by Marx and Engels. As the name attests, it was originally propounded by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. Lenin espoused the concept of the Vanguard Party. Marxist–Leninists rejected Democratic Socialism’s peaceful, parliamentary path to socialism. They argued instead argued for immediate and violent revolution. Lenin wrote ‘What is to Be Done?’ in 1903, in which he described how a dedicated core of revolutionaries could take over in nations where a large, educated proletariat did not already exist. In 1917, Lenin launched a revolution in Russia with a mix of soldier, worker, and peasant support, where a collection of ‘Soviets’ under the leadership of Lenin’s revolutionary vanguard usurped and then replaced the functions of the traditional state authorities. Marxism–Leninism never realized the utopian withering away of the state as Marx had envisioned. The revolutionary Dictatorship of the Proletariat became a dominant social class of its own. Membership in the Communist Party meant a standard of living and power above that of the ‘proletariat’ whom the revolution had been proclaimed for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

mass_advertising_desc;The rapid spread of basic functional literacy in industrial societies combined with the improvements in communication technologies to lay the basis for the development of new approaches to the promotion of creating demand for the rapidly increasing output of goods by increasingly efficient industrial systems. Drawing upon increased understanding of the nature of human compulsions shaped by the environment around them, advertisers would also learn lessons gained by States in their propaganda efforts during periods of war to rally the population to support the goals of the nation in its conflict. The result would be a rapid expansion of the use of simple, direct means of advertising to popularize new products and increase the appeal and demand for established products would become permanent features of popular culture as the twentieth century evolved, and would eventually come to impact other realms of public life, including politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

military_aviation_desc;Military aviation is the use of aircraft and other flying machines for the purposes of conducting or enabling warfare. Heavier-than-air aircraft were recognized as having military applications early on. A Wright Model A was purchased in 1909 by the U.S. Army Signal Corps, and in 1911 the Italians used a variety of aircraft types in reconnaissance, photoreconnaissance, and bombing roles as part of the Italo–Turkish War. World War I saw military aviation rapidly embrace many specialized types, such as scouts, artillery observers, fighters or bombers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

minie_ball;Minié Ball;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
minie_ball_desc;The Minié ball is a conical-shaped bullet made of iron and soft lead. It was developed in 1849 by French army captain Claude-Etienne Minié based on the work of Henri-Gustave Delvigne. The Minié bullet solved the problem of designing ammunition for the new muzzle-loaded rifles. The bullet expanded to fit the tight rifling grooves when fired, allowing for a greater muzzle velocity and range of accuracy. The greater speed and weight of the Minié ball meant wounds were more severe and required more amputations as the bullets would tear straight through and shatter muscles, tendons, and bones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

mountain_warfare_desc;Mountain warfare refers to warfare in the mountains or similarly rough terrain. This type of warfare is also called Alpine warfare, after the Alps mountains. Mountain warfare is one of the most dangerous types of combat as it involves surviving not only combat with the enemy but also the extreme weather and dangerous terrain. Mountain ranges are of strategic importance since they often act as a natural border and may also be the origin of a water source. Attacking a prepared enemy position in mountain terrain requires a greater ratio of attacking soldiers to defending soldiers than a war conducted on level ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

national_radio_networks;National Radio Networks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
national_radio_networks_desc;As the twentieth century evolved the role of wireless communication pioneered in the development of radio by Guglielmo Marconi would rapidly increase as technological changes improved the clarity and quality of radio transmissions. By the early 1920s the improvements would result in the development of a whole new medium of information exchange as radio frequencies could be used to transmit content designed to entertain, inform, or convince. Realizing the potential power of this new medium, states began to regulate the assigning of radio frequencies, with some establishing national monopolies while others allowed for the development of commercial broadcasting networks. By the early 1930s the radio set would become one of the most desired consumer goods, and its potential use to not only entertain but develop and shape public opinion would soon be seized upon by politicians and those who aspired to political power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

naval_firepower_doctrine;Naval Firepower Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
naval_firepower_doctrine_desc;While a focus on winning the decisive naval battle was important, it was also considered valuable to use a variety of weaponry in order to achieve victory, in addition to the main armament of capital ships. Lighter warships were also important, as they could dart in and launch deadly torpedo attacks, while secondary armament was necessary to defend against these attacks. A balanced fleet of both capital and escort ships was essential to victory in modern naval combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

neokantian_idealism_desc;Kant’s transcendental idealism had meant that the world can only be understood through categories, or ideal concepts that are immanent in us, and empirically. This is sometimes called weak empiricism. The neo-Kantian idealist, however, departed very far from Kant and more or less went back to a more classical idealism though interpreted in a Kantian language referring to categories in their analyses of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neoliberal_theory;Nepotism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neoliberal_theory_desc;Originally neoliberalism was an economic philosophy that emerged among European liberal scholars in the 1930s attempting to trace a so-called ‘Third’ or ‘Middle Way’ between the conflicting philosophies of classical liberalism and collectivist central planning. The impetus for this development arose from a desire to avoid repeating the economic failures of the early 1930s, which were mostly blamed on the economic policy of classical liberalism. In the decades that followed, the use of the term neoliberal tended to refer to theories at variance with the more laissez-faire doctrine of classical liberalism and promoted instead a market economy under the guidance and rules of a strong state, a model which came to be known as the social market economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

nihilism_and_the_will_desc;The foundations for the trend away from the emphasis on human rationality in philosophy in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries would be established with a revival in the interest among some philosophers in nihilism, the rejection of the idea that the life of the individual has any meaning or purpose in the grand workings of the universe. In place of the self-value of the individual as a being, focus was placed on The Will, the human ability to intervene in a situation to his own benefit. Developed most effectively in the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche in the late nineteenth century, the dramatic impact of warfare in the industrial era would lead to further refinement of the concept by philosophers such as Martin Heidegger in the early twentieth century. In its denial of the value of absolutes as guides for the conduct of human behaviour, Nihilism would help contribute to the further questioning, and for many the ultimate rejection, of the values and beliefs that had shaped the Victorian world, while the emphasis on Will would encourage action to challenge accepted practices and encourage the construction of new values.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In 1926, Otto Rank left Vienna for Paris. For the remaining 14 years of his life, Rank had a successful career as a lecturer, writer and therapist in France and the U.S. Today, Rank can be seen as one of the great pioneers in the fields of humanistic psychology, existential psychotherapy, Gestalt therapy and transpersonal psychology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
paramilitary_groups;Paramilitary Groups;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
paramilitary_groups_desc;As a result of the huge manpower requirements of militaries in an age of industrial warfare, the restoration of peace often resulted in the creation of large numbers of veterans, many of whom found it difficult to adjust to a return to civilian life and who possessed basic military training that could be put to use if needed. With the growth of revolutionary movements on the Left and particularly on the Right, the potential use of disgruntled military veterans for the purpose of challenging the actions and influence of ideological opponents grew rapidly. Their existence and growth in times of political, social and economic upheaval proved challenging to the ability of many States to maintain law and order, and the activities of such paramilitaries were often cited by those opposed to Liberal Capitalism of the inherent weakness of democracy in the face of revolutionary challenges that threatened the social order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
parkes_process;Parkes Process;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
parkes_process_desc;The Parkes process is a pyrometallurgical process for removing silver from lead during the production of bullion. The process takes advantage of two liquid-state properties of zinc. The first is that zinc is immiscible with lead, and the other is that silver is 3000 times more soluble in zinc than it is in lead. When zinc is added to liquid lead that contains silver as a contaminant, the silver preferentially migrates into the zinc. Because the zinc is immiscible in the lead it remains in a separate layer and is easily removed. The zinc-silver solution is then heated until the zinc vaporizes, leaving nearly pure silver. If gold is present in the liquid lead, it can also be removed and isolated by the same process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

percussion_drill_desc;In Europe since the late 1840s, the king of Sardinia, Carlo Alberto, had been contemplating the excavation of a 12-kilometre (7.5 mi) tunnel through Mount Fréjus to create a rail link between Italy and France, which would cross his realm. The need for a mechanical rock drill was obvious and this sparked research on pneumatic rock drills in Europe. A Frenchman, Cavé, designed, and in 1851 patented, a rock drill that used compressed air, but the air had to be admitted manually to the cylinder during each stroke, so it was not successful. In 1854, in England, Thomas Bartlett made and then patented (1855) a rock drill whose drill bit was connected directly to the piston of a steam engine. In 1855 Bartlett demonstrated his drill, powered by compressed air, to officials of the Mount Fréjus tunnel project.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

priming_the_pump__desc;In wake of a series of economic shocks that shook the world in the first part of the twentieth century some politicians would become influenced by new economic theories regarding supply and demand and their interplay in times of economic crisis. Based upon the concept that money spent in the economy has a multiplier effect that increases economic activity by generating income that can contribute to new demand, some politicians made appeals in wake of economic declines for ‘priming the pump’ to re-inflate demand and thus resume economic growth. Not all politicians and economist accepted this argument, and to some such state intervention appeared as an introduction of socialist principles into the economy, but the political impact of having the State appear to be actively trying to improve economic conditions made such political promises very appealing to those negatively impacted by economic downturns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

quantum_theory_desc;The dramatic expansion of scientific knowledge in the nineteenth century would lead to a questioning of the rational model of the basic structures of the universe that had culminated in the work of Isaac Newton in the late seventeenth century. As scientific equipment became more precise, discrepancies in the models of atomic behaviour as understood in the nineteenth century resulted in further research into the nature of atomic particles and their interaction with forces such as energy. As a result of the work of physicists such as Albert Einstein and Walter Heisenberg, the idea that the basic structures of the universe could be known with precision by humans was shown to be incorrect, and an alternative view that there were elements of unpredictability in the structure and behaviour of atomic particles would be proposed. While a major step forward in human understanding of the basic structures of matter, the emphasis of the random nature of some elements of the natural world further shook the Victorian faith in the ability of humanity to understand fully the natural world and reinforced the sense that the world was indeed not built upon completely rational behaviour and assumptions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

richard_kahn;Richard Kahn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
richard_kahn_desc;An English economist who first developed the concept of the multiplier effect of spending in an economy in the early 1930s. At its base, this is the concept that spending in the economy for goods and services produced new potentials for demand by the providers of those initial goods and services, creating an expansion of demand beyond the initial value of the original spending. Adopted by John Maynard Keynes in his concept of the role of aggregate demand in the functioning of the economy, the concept of the multiplier effect would be increasingly adopted by States facing economic slowdowns by encouraging the State itself to increase its spending in the economy as a way to revive weakened demand and restore economic growth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

roaring_twenties_desc;The Roaring Twenties is a term sometimes used to refer to the 1920s, characterizing the era’s distinctive cultural edge in most of the world’s major cities for a period of sustained economic prosperity. ‘Normalcy’ returned to politics in the wake of hyper-emotional patriotism during World War I, jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined modern womanhood, and Art Deco peaked. Economically, the era saw the large-scale diffusion and use of automobiles, telephones, motion pictures, and electricity, unprecedented industrial growth, accelerated consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in lifestyle and culture. Finally, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 ended the era, as the Great Depression set in worldwide, bringing years of worldwide gloom and hardship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

rotary_kiln_desc;The Rotary ‘endless’ kiln gives perfect control over combustion and produces a better grade of cement. The kiln is a cylindrical vessel, inclined slightly to the horizontal, which is rotated slowly about its axis. The material to be processed is fed into the upper end of the cylinder. As the kiln rotates, material gradually moves down towards the lower end, and may undergo a certain amount of stirring and mixing. Hot gases pass along the kiln, sometimes in the same direction as the process material, but usually in the opposite direction. The hot gases may be generated in an external furnace or may be generated by a flame inside the kiln.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It was lighter than the traditional plough and could be easily worked with a pair of horses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rousseau;Jean-Jacques Rousseau;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rousseau_desc;Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a French writer and philosopher. Rousseau’s many publications provided a central inspiration for the French Revolution. In ‘Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men’, Rousseau refuted Hobbes’ conception of the Social Contract as being imposed on the masses by the powerful in society, thereby instituting inequality into the civil society. In ‘The Social Contract Rousseau argued against the divine right of monarchs and asserted that sovereignty resides with the people. However, he argued that government must be separate from the legislative power of the sovereignty for the application of laws and that it was the duty of the people to abolish an overreaching government. Under his version of the Social Contract, the people had a right of freedom to withdraw from it except in time of need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

schrapnel_standard_design_desc;Shrapnel shells were anti-personnel artillery munitions which carried a large number of individual bullets close to the target and then ejected them to allow them to continue along the shell’s trajectory and strike the target individually. They relied almost entirely on the shell’s velocity for their lethality. The final shrapnel shell design bore little similarity to Henry Shrapnel’s original design, marking the quick evolution of technology at the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
schwerpunkt;Schwerpunkt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
schwerpunkt_desc;Schwerpunkt is a term referring to the ‘centre of gravity or point of maximum effort, where a decisive action could be achieved’. Ground, mechanised and tactical air forces could be concentrated at this point of maximum effort whenever possible.

shrinkage_stoping;Shrinkage Stoping;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shrinkage_stoping_desc;Shrinkage stoping is a mining method used for steeply dipping, narrower ore bodies with self-supporting walls and ore. It is an overhand mining method that relies on broken ore being left in the stope to be used as the ‘working floor’ and to support the walls. During the mining cycle, only 30 – 35% of the ore blasted is extracted being equivalent to the swell factor of in-situ ore to broken. When mining is complete to the next upper horizon, the ore is extracted. Although it is not necessary to fill the resulting voids, they are commonly filled with waste rock from development. Level intervals seldom exceed 40 meters due to uneven muck draw. Recoverable pillars are left at each level.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sidney_webb;Sidney Webb;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sidney_webb_desc;Webb developed socialist ideas while at university and in 1885 he joined the Fabian Society. The society believed that capitalism had created an unjust and inefficient society. The members agreed that the ultimate aim of the group should be to reconstruct ‘society in accordance with the highest moral possibilities’. The Fabian Society was a ‘fact-finding and fact-dispensing body’ and it produced a series of pamphlets on a wide variety of different social issues. Many of these were written by Sidney Webb including ‘Facts for Socialists’ (1887), ‘Facts for Londoners’ (1888) and ‘The Eight Hour Day’ (1891). Webb also wrote ‘A Plan on Campaign for Labour’ with George Bernard Shaw. Webb later became an important social-democratic figure with influence in the international worker organizations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

skyscrapers;Skyscrapers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
skyscrapers_desc;Modern skyscrapers are built with steel or reinforced concrete frameworks and curtain walls of glass or polished stone. They utilize mechanical equipment such as water pumps and elevators. Until the 19th century, buildings of over six storeys were rare, as having great numbers of stairs to climb was impractical for inhabitants, and water pressure was usually insufficient to supply running water above 50 m. Most early skyscrapers emerged in the land-strapped areas of Chicago, London, and New York toward the end of the 19th century. A land boom in Melbourne, Australia between 1888–1891 spurred the creation of a significant number of early skyscrapers, though none of these were steel reinforced and few remain today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

social_engineering_desc;Social engineering is a discipline in social science that refers to efforts to influence popular attitudes and social behaviours on a large scale, whether by governments or private groups. In the political arena, the counterpart of social engineering is political engineering. Virtually all law and governance have the effect of seeking to change behaviour and could be considered ‘social engineering’ to some extent. Governments also influence behaviour more subtly through incentives and disincentives built into economic policy and tax policy, for instance, and have done so for centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

socialist_realism_desc;The growing split between elite and popular forms of cultural production in the early twentieth century would merge with the rise of new anti-liberal political ideologies to result in a backlash against the cultural avant-garde by the growing power of the State in the name of ‘the people’. In both fascist and communist regimes, a new artistic ethos would develop that encouraged production that the masses could not only understand but encourage the installation of the values that these regimes wished to instil upon the societies they governed. For the cultural elite, a stark choice was offered, either accept the limits of creativity imposed by the State in one’s work or face the retribution of the State for challenging its authority. In communist regimes this new artistic ethos came to be known as Socialist Realism, but fascist regimes had their own analogous stylistic ethos which was imposed from above.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

square_set_timbering;Square-Set Timbering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
square_set_timbering_desc;Square-set timbering is a system invented by a German named Philip Deidesheimer that uses heavy timber ‘cubes’ as supports for underground mining tunnels and shafts, that enabled skilled miners to open three-dimensional cavities of any size. In large openings, the cubes can be filled with waste rock, creating a solid pillar of wood and rock from floor to roof (‘back’ in miner’s terminology). The system, which was inspired by the structure of honeycombs, enabled mining of the large silver orebodies of the Comstock Lode, which were in very weak rock—in miner’s terms, ‘heavy ground’. Deidesheimer refused to patent the innovation, which was easily the most important mining innovation of 1860.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

stanley_jevons_desc;The impact of Jevons on economics can hardly be exaggerated. As the father of Neoclassical economics, his legacy is secure. However, in some ways, he stopped short of the mark. Jevons could have gone further by connecting his insights in pure exchange into a wider theory incorporating production, capital, money and the business cycle in a more systematic and consistent manner that would have knocked the Ricardian School completely out of the picture. Had he not died so young, Jevons might yet have done so, but the next economics treatise he was working on (published posthumously in 1905), did not really seem to go in that ambitious direction. As such, by the time of his death, the Marginalist Revolution was still in its insurrectionist phase. It was still a tentative proposition rather than a firmly-set and integrated system, a scientific hypothesis but not quite yet a science. It should be noted that Jevons made maybe as much for the subject of Logics as for economics, which is quite a feat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

steam_shovel_desc;The steam shovel was the first powered excavating machine. William Otis patented an original design in 1839. Early steam shovels were ‘partial-swing’, meaning the boom and winch could not rotate a full 360 degrees. Steam shovels became more widespread in the last half of the nineteenth century with the development of steel cables and a full-swing design. Steam shovels operated on railways until the invention of caterpillar tracks, and were heavily involved in the development of large-scale, open-pit mining. 102 steam shovels were employed to excavate the Panama Canal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Savery’s steam pump used condensing steam to create a vacuum and draw water into a chamber, and then applied pressurized steam to further pump the water. Thomas Newcomen’s atmospheric engine was the first commercial true steam engine using a piston and was used in 1712 for pumping in a mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

switch_to_early_russian_tech_desc;Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality, also known as Official Nationality, was the dominant ideological doctrine of Russian emperor Nicholas I. ‘The Triad’ of Official Nationality was originally proposed by Minister of Education Sergey Uvarov in his April 2, 1833 circular letter to subordinate educators. It was soon embraced by Nicholas and his establishment and gained wide public recognition, vocally supported by intellectuals like Mikhail Pogodin, Fyodor Tyutchev and Nikolay Gogol. Critics of the policy saw this principle as a call for Russification. Yet the very fact of its existence, being Russia’s first state-wide political ideology since the sixteenth century, indicated the nation’s brewing transition to modernity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_decline_of_the_west_and_the_lost_generation_desc;The combination of the dramatic social, economic and political transformations undertaken in the nineteenth century with the rise of industry and the devastation produced by mass warfare in the industrial age created a crisis of confidence among many intellectuals that the whole structure of society was under siege and in danger of complete collapse. Oswald Spengler began work on ‘The Decline Of The West’ in 1911 as the challenges of new social, political and economic forces were shaking advanced industrial societies to their cores, with Spengler concluding that what these societies were experiencing was part of the natural cycle of civilizations that rise, have a period of brilliance, and eventually decline and collapse—a direct challenge to the Victorian idea that modern industrial society could continually be improved as a result of humanity’s rational abilities. Coined by American author Gertrude Stein, ‘The Lost Generation’ captured the sense of loss and emptiness that many veterans of Great War felt after surviving the carnage of the battlefields and questioning the values and beliefs that had encouraged their nations to participate in the conflicts in the first place. These themes of decline and loss that Spengler and Woolf developed would dominate the cultural landscape in the early twentieth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_doctrine_of_fascism_desc;The spread of revolutionary Communism in the early twentieth century as a potential alternative model to Liberal Capitalism as the basis of the organization of society would lead to the development of new models on the political Right that sought to offer a third alternative that would replace the weaknesses inherent in Liberal Capitalist systems without promoting a social revolution that would dispossess the power and status of the upper and middle classes. By the early 1920s such a model would crystallize in the evolution of Fascism. Although less rigorously defined in terms of ideological content than Communism, Fascism at its base called for the reorganization of The State for the benefit of The Nation as a whole, so that all who are defined as members of the national community, regardless of socioeconomic class, receive the benefits of modern industrial society. This would be achieved by subsuming the desires and concerns of the individual to the needs of the Nation under the leadership of a single party that would govern according to the needs of the Nation as a whole and prepare the Nation to compete successfully with other nations for power and influence in the world. Fully elaborated in the writings of the Italian Giovanni Gentile in the early 1930s, Fascism as an alternative to both Liberal Capitalism and Communism would grow rapidly in the early twentieth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The technology swiftly spread to other cities in Europe, as in Budapest, Hungary in 1896, and then to the United States. A number of elevated systems were built, starting with the 1893 100% designed electric Liverpool Overhead Railway, which also had a small underground section complete with station.

The resulting factionalism caused by the growth of political parties in wake of universal suffrage soon exposed the limitations of liberal democracy as a system for the arbitration of power in society (especially in times of social, economic or political crisis) and led to a great deal of disenchantment with the ideals of democracy as the best system of governance and a search for potential alternatives to more effectively achieve the promises of a better life for all. Written in 1930 by the Spanish intellectual Jose Ortega y Gasset, ‘The Revolt Of The Masses’ warns of the potential threat to the ideal of liberal democracy in its current limitations and the potential for the masses to overwhelm the political system and replace it with alternatives that in the end would destroy the basic principles of classic liberal democracy unless liberal democracy was able to reform itself to meet the challenges produced by mass politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_talkies_desc;The development of the cinema in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century would result in the creation of a new mass cultural activity that would soon become one of the hallmarks of the era. The power and influence of the cinema would be further enhanced when in the 1920s technological improvements allowed for the ability of sounds to be synchronized with the moving images so that not just the visual representation of a scene could be represented on screen, but its aural component as well. ‘The Jazz Singer,’ released in the United States in 1927, was the first sound motion picture, and within half a decade the silent movie had become a relic of the past, and a new, powerful medium had entered the public sphere, forever changing not only popular culture, but the nature of politics and international relations as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_white_mans_burden;The White Man’s Burden;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_white_mans_burden_desc;‘The White Man’s Burden’ was a poem by the English poet Rudyard Kipling, published in 1899. At face value it appeared to be a rhetorical command to white men to colonise and rule other nations for the benefit of those people, even though it mixed its exhortation to empire with sombre warnings of the costs involved in imperialism. Imperialists came to understand the phrase ‘white man’s burden’ as a characterization for imperialism that justified the policy as a noble enterprise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
theodor_w_adorno;Theodor W. Adorno;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
theodor_w_adorno_desc;Theodor W. Adorno was a German sociologist, philosopher and musicologist known for his critical theory of society. He was a leading member of the Frankfurt School of critical theory, whose work has come to be associated with thinkers such as Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer and Herbert Marcuse, for whom the work of Freud, Marx and Hegel were essential to a critique of modern society. He is widely regarded as one of the 20th century’s foremost thinkers on aesthetics and philosophy, as well as one of its preeminent essayists. As a critic of both fascism and what he called the culture industry, his writings—such as ‘Dialectic of Enlightenment’, ‘Minima Moralia’ and ‘Negative Dialectics’—strongly influenced the European New Left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
thomas_brown;Thomas Brown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
thomas_brown_desc;Thomas Brown was an associationist of the Scottish School, he added a secondary set of laws to complete the associationist philosophy. He built upon earlier work by broadening associationism to consider it as an active process of an active mind. This active process considered the effects of other associations, temperament and state of mind of the individual, the state of health of the body, as well as the circumstances of the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
thomas_jefferson;Thomas Jefferson;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
thomas_jefferson_desc;Thomas Jefferson was one of the ‘Founding Fathers’ of the United States of America. Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence in 1776, in which he asserted that all men had ‘certain inalienable rights’. He believed in the paramount importance of individual liberties, and argued that liberty should only be limited insofar as it infringed upon the equal rights and liberties of others. Jefferson served as the Third President of the United States from 1801 to 1809 and worked to limit the power of the federal government, favouring decentralisation and protecting the rights of individuals. Jefferson promoted science and education and believed in a wall of separation between church and state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

thorstein_veblen_desc;Thorstein Veblen is to economics what Jonathan Swift is to English literature: a master of the art of satire. Is essential to effective satire that its message be ambiguous: the reader should never be sure whether the author is absolutely serious or just pulling his or her leg That quality is certainly present in Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels and it is also present in Veblen’s Theory of the Leisure Class, The Instinct of Workmanship, Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution, The Higher Learning in America, Absentee Ownership, and his many essays. In fact, it is there in everything he wrote except The Theory of Business Enterprise, which is as near as he ever came to write a conventional academic book. No matter which of these books we open, we find the idea that life in a modern industrial community is the result of a polar conflict between ‘pecuniary employments’ and ‘industrial employments’, between ‘business enterprise’ and ‘the machine process’, between ‘vendibility’ and ‘serviceability’—in short, between making money and making goods. There is a class struggle under capitalism, not between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, but between businessmen and engineers. Pecuniary habits of thought unite bankers, brokers, lawyers and managers in a defence of private acquisition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

traction_engines_desc;The traction engine is a self-propelled steam engine. Developed in the mid-nineteenth century, they were slow, heavy, and not very manoeuvrable. However, they provided a clear revolution in road haulage of agricultural and forest products, replacing draught animals as the primary movers. Traction engines also could be used to provide a localized power source, and smaller versions were later produced that could plough fields without sinking into the soil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

trinitrotoluene;TNT;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
trinitrotoluene_desc;Trinitrotoluene, or TNT, was first prepared in 1863 by German chemist Julius Wilbrand and originally used as a yellow dye. Its potential as an explosive was not recognized for several years, mainly because it was so difficult to detonate and because it was less powerful than alternatives. Its explosive properties were first discovered by another German chemist, Carl Häussermann, in 1891. TNT is one of the most commonly used explosives for military, industrial, and mining applications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
triode;Triode;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
triode_desc;A triode is an electronic amplification device having three active electrodes.

tulls_seed_drill;Tull’s Seed Drill;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tulls_seed_drill_desc;Up until this era, farmers planted the seeds for cereal crops by carrying the seeds in a bag and walking up and down the field throwing or broadcasting the seed. They broadcast the seed by hand on to the ploughed and harrowed ground. The problem with this method was that it did not give a very even distribution. It was not, therefore, an efficient use of the seed and much of it was wasted. Jethro Tull invented a Seed Drill which could be pulled behind a horse. It consisted of a wheeled vehicle containing a box filled with grain. There was a wheel-driven ratchet that sprayed the seed out evenly as the Seed Drill was pulled across the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

vacuum_distillation;Vacuum Distillation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vacuum_distillation_desc;Vacuum distillation is a process for separating hydrocarbons using pressure. The liquid hydrocarbons are channelled into the lower portion of the distillation column at a temperature no greater than 370 degrees Celsius at an absolute pressure. The pressure in the column increases gradually from the top of the column to the bottom. The hydrocarbons evaporate and are piped out at various levels whenever the atmospheric pressure above the hydrocarbon to be distilled is lower than its vapor pressure. Vacuum distillation increases the relative volatility of the components, making the separation process quicker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vacuum_tube;Vacuum Tube;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vacuum_tube_desc;The vacuum tube is a device that utilizes the flow of current through a vacuum. In a vacuum tube electron travel via thermionic emission from a hot filament through the vacuum to a positive electrode. Additional electrodes were later interposed between the anode and cathode, enabling amplification and switching of signals. Vacuum tubes were essential to the production and commercialization of radio, telephones, TV, radar, and early computers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

vanguard_party_desc;As the Socialist movement grew in influence in some industrial nations, in other societies that were less industrialized the idea that the working class could lead an overthrow of the State and seize power was realized to be limited. Coined by the Russian socialist Vladimir Lenin in 1902, the concept of the vanguard party was that a small group of dedicated revolutionaries could lead the struggle for revolution in the name of the masses who lacked the ability or desire to carry out revolution themselves and, having achieved power in their name, establish control over the State and carry out the transformations necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of the socialist movement, the worker’s utopia. While most influential within Leftist political circles in the early twentieth century, the concept of an ideological vanguard seizing power on behalf of groups in society as a whole would also be influential on the Right as ultranationalist movements began to move towards a more concrete ideological system, Fascism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

An eclectic thinker, combining elements of German idealism, Romanticism, historical materialism, and Jewish mysticism, Benjamin made enduring and influential contributions to aesthetic theory and Western Marxism. He is associated with the Frankfurt School. His turn to Marxism in the 1930s was partly due to the influence of Bertolt Brecht, who developed a theatre notable for its Verfremdungseffekt. An earlier influence was friend Gershom Scholem, founder of the academic study of the Kabbalah and of Jewish mysticism. Scholars often cite Benjamin’s most famous works, especially the essays ‘The Task of the Translator’ and ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

war_gamming_desc;The use of war games to plan and prepare for war is as old as warfare itself and includes such hallmarks as chess. However, serious analytical naval war gaming emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Major naval powers would use detailed gaming systems that took account of such variables as a ship’s armour, speed, and the number and calibre of guns in order to determine battle damage and the ultimate victor. These naval war games were used to test strategic plans, and different means of countering potential enemy strategies and warships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Roscher’s work emphasized the developmental character of capitalism through detailed historical analyses of the cultures of ancient nations. His ‘System der Volkswirtschaft’ (5 vol., 1854–94, tr. of 13th ed., ‘Principles of Political Economy’, 1878) was an influential textbook in the second half of the 19th cent. His most significant work is ‘Geschichte der National-oekonomik in Deutschland’ (1874).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

This was the foundation of Cognitive Psychology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
william_cunningham;William Cunningham;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
william_cunningham_desc;Cunningham was a vocal opponent of the nascent Neoclassical economics, particularly as propounded by his colleague, Alfred Marshall and the Cambridge School. In economics, he sought to promote the historical method, making him one of the most leading advocates of the English Historical School. Despite the sustained attacks levied by Cunningham, Marshall was sufficiently influenced by his pleas to try to include some more historical content in his work and operate more ‘inductively’ in the derivation of his economic principles. However, he refused to accept Cunningham’s main charge — that the validity of economic laws is conditional on historical, social and cultural context. Cunningham’s opposition to Neoclassicism was not only one of method, but also of politics. Cunningham was deeply opposed to utilitarian philosophy and laissez-faire politics, and penned several tracts defending labour unions and protectionism. He also resurrected much interest in old Mercantilist thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

This allowed naval headquarters to communicate with fleets at sea in order to give updated orders, and also allowed admirals to communicate much more effectively with individual warships in their fleets, in comparison with older methods such as signal flags. However, one drawback of wireless was that it was also possible for the enemy to listen in on wireless communications, and soon the major navies would establish organizations to glean valuable intelligence from enemy communications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Stalin launched what would later be referred to as a "revolution from above" to improve the Soviet Union’s domestic policy. The policies were centered around rapid industrialization and the collectivization of agriculture. Stalin desired to remove and replace any policies created under the New Economic Policy. The plan, overall, was to transition the Soviet Union from a weak, poorly controlled, agriculture state, into an industrial powerhouse. While the vision was grand, its planning was ineffective and unrealistic given the short amount of time given to meet the desired goals.;;;;;;;x

create_rocket_title;Develop a working Space Rocket;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
create_rocket_desc;In spaceflight, a launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket used to carry a payload from Earth's surface into outer space. A launch system includes the launch vehicle, the launch pad, and other infrastructure. Although a carrier rocket's payload is often an artificial satellite placed into orbit, some spaceflights, such as sounding rockets, are sub-orbital, while others enable spacecraft to escape Earth orbit entirely. Earth orbital launch vehicles typically have at least two stages, and sometimes as many as four or more.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
create_satellite_title;Develop a working Space Satellite;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
create_satellite_desc;In the context of spaceflight, a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit. Such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as Earth's Moon. Approximately 500 operational satellites are in low-Earth orbit, 50 are in medium-Earth orbit (at 20,000 km), and the rest are in geostationary orbit (at 36,000 km). A few large satellites have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit. Over a dozen space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, a few asteroids, and the Sun. Satellites are used for many purposes. Common types include military and civilian Earth observation satellites, communications satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and space telescopes. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites. Satellite orbits vary greatly, depending on the purpose of the satellite, and are classified in a number of ways. Well-known (overlapping) classes include low Earth orbit, polar orbit, and geostationary orbit. Satellites are propelled by rockets to their orbits. Usually the launch vehicle itself is a rocket lifting off from a launch pad on land. Some satellites are launched at sea (from a submarine or a mobile maritime platform) or aboard a plane (see air launch to orbit). Satellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems. Satellite subsystems attend many tasks, such as power generation, thermal control, telemetry, attitude control and orbit control.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
create_space_man_title;Start a send a man into space program;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
create_space_man_desc;Human spaceflight (also referred to as manned spaceflight) is space travel with a crew or passengers aboard the spacecraft.

create_space_station_title;Create a working space station;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
create_space_station_desc;A space station, also known as an orbital station or an orbital space station, is a spacecraft capable of supporting crewmembers, which is designed to remain in space (most commonly as an artificial satellite in low Earth orbit) for an extended period of time and for other spacecraft to dock. A space station is distinguished from other spacecraft used for human spaceflight by lack of major propulsion or landing systems. Instead, other vehicles transport people and cargo to and from the station.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
create_space_probe_title;Set up a space exploration program using space probes;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
create_space_probe_desc;A robotic spacecraft is an uncrewed spacecraft, usually under telerobotic control. A robotic spacecraft designed to make scientific research measurements is often called a space probe. Many space missions are more suited to telerobotic rather than crewed operation, due to lower cost and lower risk factors. In addition, some planetary destinations such as Venus or the vicinity of Jupiter are too hostile for human survival, given current technology. Outer planets such as Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are too distant to reach with current crewed spaceflight technology, so telerobotic probes are the only way to explore them.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Cernan was the last to step off the lunar surface. All Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the Command Module. The last three missions had a rover for increased mobility.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
space_fundings_title;Government Funding of Space Mission Policy;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
space_fundings_desc;In the early decades of the Space Age, the government space agencies of the Soviet Union and United States pioneered space technology in collaboration with affiliated design bureaus in the USSR and private companies in the US, entirely funding both the development of new spaceflight technologies and the operational costs of spaceflight. The European Space Agency was formed in 1975, largely following the same model of space technology development. Later on, large defense contractors began to develop and operate space launch systems, derived from government rockets. Private spaceflight in Earth orbit includes communications satellites, satellite television, satellite radio, astronaut transport and sub-orbital and orbital space tourism.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

request_military_aid_desc;We are at war, but we do not have a great power on our side! For whatever audacious reason, the great power we have alligned ourselves to has not commited themselves to our cause. We must find some form of support from them with much haste, or our prospects in this war may be slim. Even if we choose to ask for some kind of military assistance, it will take some time before they arrive, we must hold our own until then.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

establish_death_camp_title;Set up Concentration Camps;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
establish_death_camp_desc;A labour Concentration Camp or work camp is a simplified detention facility where inmates are forced to engage in penal labor as a form of punishment under the criminal code. Labor camps have many common aspects with slavery and with prisons (especially prison farms). Conditions at labor camps vary widely depending on the operators. In the 20th century, a new category of labor camps developed for the imprisonment of virtual millions of people who were not criminals per se, but political opponents (real or imagined) and various so-called undesirables under the totalitarian, both communist and fascist regimes. Some of those camps were dubbed "reeducation facilities" for political coercion, but most others served as backbone of industry and agriculture for the benefit of the state especially in times of war.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC37299;Ever since the abolishment of slavery the African population of our country would flock back to the African continent is search of better life and/or freedom.

EVTNAME1000200;The New Protector of Eastern Christians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000200;Now that we are powerful enough to hold our own, an important matter rose up regarding our role in the Eastern Christendom. It is a well known fact that the Byzantine Empire for a long time was the center of the Orthodox Church and the Eastern Christendom as a whole. Sadly, we've lost our authority and power due to numerous wars and raids and our title as the protector was taken by an another powerful Orthodox nation known as the Russian Empire. We are glad that they've been doing our work for centuries now, but it's time that we take this title back since it's supposed to be us that should protect the Eastern Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME1000201;The Orthodox Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000201;We've been notified that the newly restored Byzantine Empire seeks to recaim its title as the Orthodox Protector. We've taken their duty to continue protecting the Eastern Christendom as a powerful nation within it. Should we stand down and give the title back to its original owner, or should we hold onto it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME1000202;The Russian Empire refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000202;The fools of The Russian Empire refuted our rightfull claim on the title of the Orthodox Protector. The title is ours by definition and they will pay for denying us our claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME1000203;The Russian Empire accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000203;As we expected, the Russians complied and offered back the title of Eastern Protectors. This is a joyous day for the mighty Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME1000204;The War is Won!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000204;We have proven in battle that we are truly worth the title we were fighting for. The Russian Empire will have to agree to our demands and our position in the Eastern Christendom will be restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME1000205;The War is Lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In addition, they occupy land which we could use to invite more settlers from the United States. They've already dealt with their own native populations by confining them in reservations, which happened to be across our northern border. We should do the same with our own, and send them there as well. They will oppose this, naturally, and even fight us. However, we are confident we will have no problem forcing them to move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99902;The Barrackpore mutiny was a rising of native Indian sepoys against their British officers in Barrackpore in November 1824. The incident occurred when the British East India Company was fighting the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–26) under the leadership of the governor-general of India William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst. The mutiny had its roots in British insensitivity towards Indian cultural sentiments, combined with negligence and poor supply arrangements, which caused growing resentment amongst the sepoys of several regiments of the Bengal Native Infantry after a long march from Mathura to Barrackpore. The lack of transport for personal effects and cultural concerns about being transported by sea caused apprehension and when troops from the 47th Native Infantry appeared on parade, the troops refused to march towards Chittagong, unless their grievances were remedied. Attempts to resolve the dispute failed and dissent spread to elements of the 26th and 62nd Regiments. The Commander-in-Chief, India, General Sir Edward Paget, ordered the troops to lay down their arms before considering their requests for redress. When the sepoys refused, their camp was surrounded by loyal soldiers from the 26th and 62nd Regiments and two British regiments. After a final ultimatum, the camp was attacked with artillery and infantry and around 180 sepoys were killed, as were a number of civilian bystanders. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

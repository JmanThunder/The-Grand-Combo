EVTDESCOUTBREAK_ANNOUNCEMENT;Our diplomats in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has confirmed reports of a number of sizeable outbreaks of the Solomon Virus in major cities, it’s best we keep an eye on this. (Advice: Use Revolt risk Map mode to track infected provinces, 9 brigades minimum to prevent or remove infections though more than that is recommended due to brigades defecting, infected ports in the same continent cause infections you can declare war & blockade to stop the spread).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCOUTBREAK_BOOST_LOCAL;The natives tell of a sickness that darkens the soul, causing a thirst for the blood of their brothers. They tell of men, women, and even children whose flesh have become grey with rot and possess an unholy smell. Once darkened, there is no method of healing, save death, and that can only be achieved through fire, since the body becomes resistant to all arms of man. This text was supposedly taken from the accounts of Father Esteban Negron, 1523.

EVTNAMEOUTBREAK_PLAYER_VICTORY;The Battle of $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCOUTBREAK_PLAYER_VICTORY_NATION;New tactics and equipment developed since the initial outbreak have helped suppress the zombie outbreak. Traditionally, our men were taught to shoot for the chest because it is the hardest to miss. Since the initial outbreak, they have been trained to shoot for the head and disable a zombie in one go. Likewise, the new Standard Infantry Rifle (SIR) has been developed as a more accurate and semi-automatic alternative to traditional rifles. On a unit-level, soldiers were taught to fire with mechanical precision and alternate with a partner: one soldier shoots while the other reloads. Effectively, the advent of repeating rifles and new military tactics have led us to ultimate victory against the zombie hordes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEOUTBREAK_PLAYER_VICTORY_NATION;Victory in $COUNTRYNAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCOUTBREAK_RESURGE;We had cleared our country of zombies, but now they have crossed our border once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEOUTBREAK_RESURGE;The Zombies Are Back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCOUTBREAK_SOE_END;It is no longer necessary to allocate so much of our government’s resources to the military. As such, we’ve restored the bureaucracy and returned power to the government proper. No longer shall our country be under military jurisdiction and its corrupt junta!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEOUTBREAK_SOE_END;Government Powers Restored!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCOUTBREAK_SOF_END;Alongside the state of emergency came a classification system to measure the intensity of a zombie outbreak. Class One outbreaks, for example, occur in rural areas and experience minimal casualties. Class Two outbreaks, meanwhile, occur in urban areas, but can be suppressed by local authorities. Then, Class Three outbreaks present a clear threat to national security and require the regular military to suppress the outbreak. Fortunately, our military crushed the zombie outbreak at Class Three and prevented the breakdown of law, or a Class Four outbreak. While there are nations that teeter between Class Three and Four outbreaks, ours is only endangered by isolated Class One outbreaks. Therefore, your advisors have come and ask that you end the state of emergency. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEOUTBREAK_SOF_END;End;the;State;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCOUTBREAK_SOF_START;By declaring a state of emergency, we have suspended the normal functions of the executive, legislative, and judicial powers and handed extensive political control over to the military. As such, elections are suspended and we’ve pulled together emergency funds and resources to combat the zombie menace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCOUTBREAK_START;One of our ambassadors reports that a strange plague broke out in some remote location. Though nobody important really cares, there are some who claim this is a resurgence of the legendary Solomon Virus and a sign of the coming Rapture. A passage from Zechariah describes it as such: ‘This will be the plague the Lord strikes all people who warred against Jerusalem: their flesh shall rot while they stand on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. On that day, a large-scale panic from the Lord will spread among them. One person will grab the hand of another, and one will attack the other.’;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEOUTBREAK_START;A Mysterious Plague…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCOUTBREAK_START_LOCAL;They call it the Solomon Virus. It travels through the bloodstream, enters the brain, and uses the cells of the frontal lobe to replicate. However, this section of the brain is destroyed in the process and all bodily functions cease. Alive but dormant, the brain is slowly transformed by the virus into a completely new organ whose most notable trait is its independence from oxygen. By removing this all-important resource, the body is no longer dependent on complex support mechanisms such as the heart and lungs. Once mutation is complete, the new organ reanimates the body to transfer the virus. Historically, outbreaks of virus were few and far between, occurring infrequently in Ancient Egypt, Israel, and even noted to be the cause of Roman Order XXXVII and the construction of Hadrian’s Wall. Some of the most recent cases include the ‘mysterious’ disappearance of the Roanoke Island settlers in 1587 and a 1762 outbreak on St. Lucia in the Caribbean. That is, of course, until today… (Advice: Use Revolt risk Map mode to track infected provinces, 9 brigades minimum to prevent or remove infections though more than that is recommended due to brigades defecting, infected ports in the same continent cause infections you can declare war & blockade to stop the spread).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCOUTBREAK_TETW;Civilization has completely broken down, and law is no longer kept. Any densely populated area in the world has thousands of zombies walking the streets. The world’s population has been reduced to almost nothing, and the number of survivors has been limited to fewer than 500000 The world leaders that haven’t already been slaughtered are hiding in bunkers, waiting to starve to death. To quote a contemporary biologist, ‘No help will come for anyone as the zombies slowly devour all life on the planet causing the end of humanity and eventually the end of all life on earth due to the rapid removal of so many creatures from the global ecosystem. After a time, the zombies will all rot away leaving the earth an empty barren wasteland.’;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCZ999101;Parts of our country have recently fallen under zombie control, and neither the local government nor the military have been able to restore order. Since we are unable to maintain control over the area, our people and the international community have come to refer to it as Zombieland’: A wasteland where all societal structure has collapsed and where zombies roam freely. Future habitation will require extensive reconstruction and repopulation we estimate that the province’s human population is less than 20% of what it was in 1836, if not lower…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC42069;Under the red-eyed glare of Austria, the increasingly hazy leader of the German Confederation, comes the burning inevitability that all our ambitions of conquest will go up in smoke. We must be careful not to set too high our sights, as though we can attempt to hash out our differences, the bubbling fury of the major powers of the Confederation will certainly render blunt our attempts at warfare, even among the weeds and worms of irrelevant German states.\n \n NOTE: This event grants 5 infamy whenever a minor state in the German Confederation falls below 7 infamy. This reduces the frequency of wars within the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

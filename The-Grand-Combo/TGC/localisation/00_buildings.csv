aeroplane_factory;Aeroplane Factory;Usine d'avions;Flugzeugfabrik;;;;;;;;;;;x
aeroplane_factory_desc;Most aircraft in the era are constructed from wood, using metal sockets to joint members, and making use of piano wire or stranded steel cable for bracing. Wooden construction typically involved several different types of timber, with careful use of different woods according to their mechanical properties and they were typically covered in a variety of fabrics including rubberized cotton and varnished silk. The first engine design to be widely used for powering aircraft was the Antoinette water-cooled V-8 engine, believed to be the very first V-form eight-cylinder internal combustion engine ever placed in production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ammunition_factory;Ammunition Factory;Usine de munitions;Munitionsfabrik;;;;;;;;;;;x
ammunition_factory_desc;Swaging, rather than casting, was the preferred manufacturing technique during the 19th century for ammunition. Swaged bullets are bullets manufactured by swaging room temperature metals into a die to form it into the shape of a bullet. The other common manufacturing method is casting, which uses molten metals poured into a mould. Disadvantages became evident as loadings shifted to smokeless powder in the late 19th century and manufacturers of high-velocity military ammunition modified their bullet swaging process to apply a thin sheet of stronger metal over the soft lead bullet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
artillery_factory;Artillery Factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
artillery_factory_desc;The first stage of artillery production is to create an exact model of the gun, mortar, or howitzer. This is built up upon a tapered wooden spindle, from eight to 12 feet in length and about two inches less than the model in diameter. The spindle is then set upon a wooden turning frame and covered with grease or soap to aid in its eventual removal from the mould. A coat of a lye mixture is spread over the interior surface to prevent the molten metal of the casting adhering to the walls of the mould. The mould is then taken to the casting pit to be annealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
automobile_factory;Automobile Factory;Usine d'automobiles;Automobilfabrik;;;;;;;;;;;x
automobile_factory_desc;Early automobiles, known as ‘Horseless Carriages’, were simple vehicles with two or four stroke combustion engines capable of 2/3 horsepower (0.50 kW) at 250 rpm. Featuring an open crankcase and the use of a pushrod-operated poppet valve for exhaust, a large horizontal flywheel that stabilized the single-cylinder engine’s power output and an evaporative carburettor controlled by a sleeve valve to regulate power and engine speed. They were produced in small workshops but evolved fast, with the simple open metal frame soon giving way to chassis with glass windows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

canned_food_factory;Cannery;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
canned_food_factory_desc;The canning concept is based on experimental food preservation work in glass containers by the French inventor Nicolas Appert. The fabrication of most cans results in at least one ‘rim’, a narrow ring whose outside diameter is slightly larger than that of the rest of the can. The flat surfaces of rimmed cans are recessed from the edge of any rim (toward the middle of the can) by about the width of the rim: the inside diameter of a rim, adjacent to this recessed surface, is slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the rest of the can. Canned food is mainly used for military rations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cement_factory;Cement Factory;Cimenterie;Betonfabrik;;;;;;;;;;;x
cement_factory_desc;In 1824 Joseph Aspdin, a British bricklayer turned builder, patented a chemical process for making Portland cement which was an important advance in the building trades. This process involves sintering a mixture of clay and limestone to about 1400 °C (2552 °F), then grinding it into a fine powder which is then mixed with water, sand, and gravel to produce concrete. Concrete is used to build factories, forts, shipyards, buildings, sewage systems and tunnels. Its use quickly became widespread in civil and military construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Electric gears are needed for a variety of things, among them automobiles, telephones, radios, and aeroplanes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
explosives_factory;Explosives Factory;Usine d'explosifs;Sprengstofffabrik;;;;;;;;;;;x
explosives_factory_desc;The explosives factory manufactures a variety of components for industrial and military use like nitroglycerin, dynamite and black powder. In the early 19th century black power was the main fabricated component, used to mine for minerals, break rocks, clear fields, and make roads. With the invention of dynamite, mines could be dug deeper and more quickly, and uneconomical deposits thus became profitable. Still, the main use of explosives was in the military industry: bombs, gunpowder, ordnances. For infantry, artillery or sappers, the use of explosives and gunpowder was central in the army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fabric_factory;Textile Mill;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fabric_factory_desc;Fabric is a tightly woven textile made in a textile mill which is, among other things, used to produce sails for ships as well as clothing. With the Cartwright Loom, the Spinning Mule and the Boulton & Watt steam engine, the pieces were in place to build a mechanized textile industry. From this point there were no new inventions, but a continuous improvement in technology as the mill-owner strove to reduce cost and improve quality. Developments in the transport infrastructure facilitated the import of raw materials and export of finished cloth, diminishing costs and increasing profits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fertilizer_factory;Fertilizer Factory;Usine d’engrais;Düngerfabrik;;;;;;;;;;;x
fertilizer_factory_desc;In this factory fertilizer is created out of guano, sulphur, or bone meal. The most common way to create fertilizer is the Birkeland-Eyde process. This process was used to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into nitric acid (HNO3), one of several chemical processes generally referred to as nitrogen fixation. The resultant nitric acid was then used as a source of nitrate (NO3-) for the fertilizers. These fertilizers are used to increase the productivity of farms or the chemical components are further refined to make explosives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

furniture_factory_desc;Well-off pops live in very comfortable houses, although their servants lived in cramped quarters, often in the attic. During the 19th century, for the first time in history furniture was mass-produced. That meant it was cheaper but unfortunately standards of design fell. In the early 19th century skilled workers usually lived in ‘through houses’ i.e. ones that were not joined to the backs of other houses while the general populace often lived in ‘back-to-backs’. These were houses of three (or sometimes only two) rooms, one of top of the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
glass_factory;Glass Factory;Verrerie;Glashütte;;;;;;;;;;;x
glass_factory_desc;A new method of producing glass, known as the cylinder process, was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832, this process was used by the Chance Brothers to create sheet glass. This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. The other glass-making method is glassblowing which produces bottles and other containers. Glass is used for a variety of appliances like bottles, windows, bowls, vases, lamps, jars, vacuum tubes, and light bulbs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

liquor_distillery_desc;The continuous still allowed the alcohol industry to reach new levels of productivity. The still consists of a first column (called the analyser) in a column still that has steam rising and wash descending through several levels. The second column (called the rectifier) carries the alcohol from the wash, where it circulates until it can condense at the required strength. It behaves like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. The tube is filled with either porous packing or bubble plates. The rising vapor, starts to condense in the cooler, higher level of the column.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lumber_mill;Sawmill;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lumber_mill_desc;At the sawmill, the logs are cut into boards using equipment such as circular saws and bandsaws. This is called conversion. The first stage of conversion is a process called breaking down, which means rough sawing. The second stage is called resawing and refers to more accurate / precise cutting and finishing, such as planing and further machining. The introduction of steam power in the 19th century created many new possibilities for mills, with steam powered sawmills being far more mechanized and scrap lumber from the mill providing a ready fuel source for firing the boiler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

steamer_shipyard_desc;The key innovation that made steamers viable is the change from the paddle-wheel to the screw-propeller for propulsion. Steam engines are designed with the power delivered at the bottom of the machinery, to give direct drive to the propeller shaft, where it passes to the stern tube through the hull. Since the motive power of screw propulsion is delivered along the shaft, a thrust bearing is needed to transfer that load without excessive friction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
steel_factory;Steel Mill;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
steel_factory_desc;Steel is an alloy of iron and other elements, primarily carbon, used in construction and other applications. When iron is smelted from its ore it contains more carbon than is desirable. To become steel, it must be reprocessed to reduce the carbon to the correct amount, at which point other elements can be added. Steel mills cast the raw iron into ingots which are stored until further refinement processes. The steel ingots are then heated in a soaking pit and hot rolled into slabs, blooms, or billets. Those are rolled into sheet metal, plates, bars, rods, wires, and structural steel, such as I-beams and rails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

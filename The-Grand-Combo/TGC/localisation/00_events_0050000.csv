EVTNAME50000;Republican Revolution?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50000;The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country. To avert a republican backlash, the government adopted a series of credit and military policies and reforms to appease the land owners. The measures made by the government alarmed the civilian republicans and the Positivists in the military corps. They saw that it would undercut support for their own aims, and were emboldened to further action. For them, it had become a case of ‘now or never’. Although there was no desire in Brazil among the majority of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring the Positivist officers to overthrow the monarchy. The Positivists launched a coup d’état and tried to institute a republic on November 15, 1889. During the whole ordeal Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome. He only commented:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50002;Vargas was born in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, into a family prominent in state politics. By 1922 he had risen rapidly in state politics and was elected to the National Congress, in which he served for four years. In 1926 Vargas became minister of finance in the Cabinet of President Washington Luís Pereira de Sousa, a post he retained until his election as governor of Rio Grande do Sul in 1928. From his position as state governor, Vargas campaigned unsuccessfully as reform candidate for the presidency of Brazil in 1930. While appearing to accept defeat, Vargas in October of that year led the revolution, organized by his friends, that overthrew the oligarchical republic. For the next 15 years Vargas assumed largely dictatorial powers, ruling most of that time without a congress. He held sole power as provisional president from Nov. 3, 1930, until July 17, 1934, when he was elected president by the constituent assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50003;The village of Paraibuna emerged in the early nineteenth century due to the occupation of the region by families of farmers and settlers coming of the former gold producing region (Ouro Preto and Mariana). The county of Paraibuna was separated from Barbacena on May 31, 1850, and was elevated to Paraibuna City in 1856, surpassing the city of São João del Rey. In 1865 the city of Paraibuna was renamed Juiz de Fora.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50004;García Moreno’s death in 1875, as he himself might have forecast, brought a period of near anarchy. Conservatives and liberals struggled for power. But Ecuador had become part of the world market: the importance of the coast slowly increased, and the liberals of that area increasingly dominated the economy. A new liberal hero emerged from the lower classes as the leader of the coastal reaction to Sierra conservatism and clericalism. A man of great personal magnetism, Gen. Eloy Alfaro led a march against the Sierra in 1895 and after a year…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50005;Solano López died in combat. Paraguay lay ruins, with more than half of its former population dead. This brought the end of the War of the Triple Alliance in $YEAR$ and under a liberal constitution promulgated in $YEAR$, Paraguay began a painful reconstruction. The constitution…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50005;The Liberal Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50006;After the War of the Pacific, a vigorous debate among civilian elites spawned the development of new political parties. Mining entrepreneurs, who had become the most important economic group in the country, created the Conservative Party. Conservatives favoured reaching a quick peace settlement with Chile that would include indemnification for lost territories and enable Bolivia to construct a railroad for mining exports. The Liberal Party denounced the pacifism of the Conservatives. Despite these differences, both parties were primarily interested in political and economic modernization, and their ideological outlooks were similar. The governments in power from 1880 to 1920-elected by a small, literate electorate brought Bolivia its first relative political stability and prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50007;In 1898, La Paz was made the de facto seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potosí to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites. This changed marked the end of the Conservative Party dominance and the era of the Liberal Party that ruled until 1920.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50008;In 1894, Nicolás de Piérola, after allying his party with the Civil Party of Peru to organize guerrillas with fighters to occupy Lima, ousted Andrés Avelino Cáceres and once again became president of Peru in 1895. After a brief period in which the military once again controlled the country, civilian rule was permanently established with Pierola’s election in 1895. His second term was successfully completed in 1899 and was marked by his reconstruction of a devastated Peru by initiating fiscal, military, religious, and civil reforms. Until the 1920s, this period was called the ‘Aristocratic Republic’, since most of the presidents that ruled the country were from the social elite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50009;The course of Venezuelan history changed markedly at the turn of the 20th century. In 1899 General Cipriano Castro, a caudillo from the Andean state of Táchira, descended on Caracas with his provincial army and seized the presidency. As a result, five successive military strongmen from Táchira, known as Andinos, controlled the nation for the next 59 years, except for an interlude in 1945-48. The longest rule being the one of General Juan Vicente Gómez. Gómez was an effective, if ruthless, dictator. By manipulating elections, abolishing all organized political activity, and monopolizing appointive powers, he established a completely subservient legislative and judicial structure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50011;Urquiza called the San Nicolás Agreement, so that all provinces agreed to convene the 1853 Constituent Assembly. This was resisted in Buenos Aires, and the unitarians took advantage of a temporary absence of Urquiza from the city to do the September 11 revolution and secede Buenos Aires from the confederation. It was now the State of Buenos Aires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50012;Buenos Aires attempted military actions against the Confederation, to prevent the work of the Assembly, but failed. The Argentine Constitution of 1853 was sanctioned on May 1, 1853, inviting Buenos Aires to return. Buenos Aires wrote their own constitution in 1854. Both countries, the Confederation and the State of Buenos Aires, accepted the status quo, with a serious danger of becoming a definitive secession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50014;Various hostilities between the Argentine Confederation and the State of Buenos Aires culminated in the 1861 Battle of Pavón, and to victory on the part of Mitre and Buenos Aires over Urquiza’s national forces. President Santiago Derqui, who had been backed by Urquiza, resigned, and the Argentine Confederation was replaced by the Argentine Republic on December 17, 1861. Mitre, who despite victory reaffirmed his commitment to the 1860 constitutional amendments, was elected the republic’s first president in 1862.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC55560;After the loss of Alsace-Lorraine, the republic that was proclaimed early in the afternoon of Saturday, November 9, 1918, is often called the ‘accidental republic.’ When Friedrich Ebert, the leader of the so-called Majority Socialists, accepted the imperial chancellorship from Max von Baden, it was with the understanding that he would do his utmost to save the imperial system from revolution. Ebert believed that the only way to accomplish this would be by transforming Germany into a constitutional monarchy. Elections would have to be held for a constituent assembly, whose task it would be to draw up a new constitution…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

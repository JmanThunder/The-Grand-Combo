brazilian_rubber_boom_desc;The rubber boom or Ciclo da borracha was an important part of the economic and social history of Brazil and Amazonian regions of neighbouring countries, being related to the extraction and commercialization of rubber. Centred in the Amazon Basin, the boom resulted in a large expansion of European colonization in the area, attracting immigrant workers, generating wealth and causing cultural and social transformations. It encouraged the growth of cities such as Manaus, Porto Velho, and Belém, capitals within the respective Brazilian states of Amazonas, Rondônia and Pará.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
buda_pest_desc;Buda and Pest were originally two separate cities on the two banks of the Danube, with Buda being Hungary’s political capital and Pest an industrial and economic centre. The two cities eventually grew together and were connected by a railroad bridge, which led to their legal unification and renaming as Budapest in 1873.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
buda_pest_title;Budapest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
budapest_united_desc;In the 18th and 19th century Pest became the natural commercial, transportation, industrial and cultural centre of Hungary while nearby towns of Buda and Óbuda remained small. The Chain Bridge linking Buda with Pest was opened some time ago as the first permanent bridge across the Danube and every day the town of Pest grows in importance, rivalling Vienna. But to have a modern metropolis, with enough space for a growing population and big enough to accommodate the ever-growing Pest, it would be wise if we unified the three towns of Buda, Óbuda and Pest in one capital: Budapest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

build_belo_horizonte_desc;This year, it was agreed by government officials that a new state capital, in tune with a modern and prosperous Minas Gerais, had to be set. Due to the climatic and topographic conditions, Curral Del Rey was selected by Minas Gerais governor Afonso Pena among other cities as the location for the new economic and cultural centre of the state, under the new name of ‘Belo Horizonte’ or Beautiful Horizon. Aarão Reis, an urbanist from the State of Pará, was then set to design the second planned city of Brazil, and then Belo Horizonte was finally inaugurated, with many unfinished constructions as the Brazilian Government set a deadline for its completion. The city flourished under the newfound iron deposits in the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

centralize_kurdish_states_desc;Administration in the border with Persia has long been rudimentary, lacking a central authority and being ruled by Kurdish tribes’ leaders in the name of the Caliph.

claim_argentina_chaco_desc;The Gran Chaco has been a disputed territory since 1810.

claim_korea_desc;With Korea under foreign rule, our nation feels threatened.

claim_namibia_desc;The sparsely inhabited lands of Namibia to our North-West have begun to attract the attention of the Great Powers, and we may soon find an aggressive colonial power moving in next door. It is critical for the maintenance of our national security that we take this area to prevent this. Of particular interest is the bay called Angra Pequena by the Portuguese, as a Hanseatic merchant from Hamburg named Adolf Lüderitz has expressed interest in a partnership with our colonial company to settle the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_sakhalin_china_desc;The eastern natural frontier of $COUNTRY$ always has been the Sakhalin islands, but our nation has been humiliated for too long by the foreign barbarians.

colonize_uriankhai_desc;After the demarcation of the Sino-Russian border by the Treaty of Kyakhta (1727), the Qing inexplicably placed border guards south of the Tannu-ola Mountains separating Tannu Uriankhai from Outer Mongolia, not along the Sayan Mountains separating the region from Russia. During the 19th century, Russians began to settle in Tuva. The Qing Dynasty allowed Russians to settle providing that they lived in boats or tents. This historical basis and the Russian population living there provides us with an excuse to add the territory of Tannu Tuva to the Russian borders, and the founding of a new Russian city will only strengthen our claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

conquer_conakry_desc;Since the 18th century, Portuguese, British and French traders had established small stations on the coast which was called Rivières du Sud by the French. The Portuguese had trading stations at Rio Pongo and Rio Nunez, mostly for the purchase of enslaved Africans captured inland and brought to the coast. By 1820, British suppression of the slave trade and Portuguese imperial decline saw these posts abandoned, with British and French traders moving in. The French admiral Bouët-Willaumez made a number of treaties with coastal communities in the area (usually under the threat of force), and ensured Marseilles based trade houses exclusive access to the palm oil trade by the 1840s. Used for making soap, the palm oil trade was with Diola merchants who established markets in the interior, and transported it to the coastal stations. We can formalize the colonial structure of these trade posts and routes to effectively take control of Conakry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

conquest_of_mocamedes_desc;The bay that the called Angra do Negro was first explored by the Portuguese in 1785, and was claimed for Portugal by Luís Cândido Cordeiro Pinheiro Furtado, who had been sent there in the frigate Loanda by the then governor-general of Angola, Baron Moçâmedes, who also sent an overland expedition headed by Gregório José Mendes to rendezvous with Furtado. It was they who renamed the bay Moçâmedes in honour of the man who had sent them. In $YEAR$ the then governor-general of Angola sent a fresh expedition to subdue the Sobas or chieftains of the region and establish them as vassals of $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

convention_of_peking_desc;Since the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), the Russian Empire has recognized the Aigun river and the Stanovoy mountains as the natural frontiers between Russia and China. There are many within the government, however, who believe it would be in our best interest to access a southern port upon the Sea of Japan-namely the Chinese city of Haishenwai. Considering the Chinese only barely control their north-eastern provinces, it seems within our right to negotiate for their control… and with their state of turmoil now is the best time to approach them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

establish_karafuto_prefecture_desc;The name Karafuto comes from Ainu kamuy kar put ya mosir, which means ‘the island a god has created on the estuary (of Amur River)’. It was formerly known as Kita Ezo, meaning Northern Ezo (Ezo was the former name for Hokkaido).\n\nJapanese settlement on Sakhalin dates to at least the Edo period. Otomari was established in 1679, and cartographers of the Matsumae domain mapped the island, and named it ‘Kita-Ezo’. Japanese cartographer and explorer Mamiya Rinzo established that Sakhalin was an island through his discovery of what is now named Mamiya Strait (Strait of Tartary) in 1809. Japan unilaterally proclaimed sovereignty over the whole island in 1845, but its claims were not recognized by the Russian Empire.\n\nKarafuto shall be officially designated an external territory of $COUNTRY$, and its administration and development came under the aegis of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

form_mittelafrika_desc;Mittelafrika (‘Middle Africa’) is the name created for a geostrategic region in central and east Africa. Much like Mitteleuropa, it articulated Germany’s foreign policy aims at the end of the long 19th century. The difference between the two was that Mittelafrika would be an agglomeration of German colonies in Africa, while Mitteleuropa was conceptualised as a geostrategic buffer zone between Germany and Russia to be filled with puppet states. \n\nGerman strategic thinking was that if the region between the colonies of German East Africa, German South-West Africa, and Cameroon could be annexed, a contiguous entity could be created covering the breadth of the African continent from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. Given the richness in natural resources of the Belgian Congo alone, this region would accrue considerable wealth to the colonising power through the exploitation of natural resources, as well as contributing to another German aim of economic self-sufficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_pakistan_desc;The movement for Muslim self-awakening and identity was started by the Muslim modernist and reformer Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, considered the architect of the two-nation theory. The two-nation theory is the ideology that the primary identity and unifying denominator of Muslims in the South Asian subcontinent is their religion, rather than their language or ethnicity, and therefore Indian Hindus and Muslims are two distinct nations, regardless of ethnic or other commonalities. To counter critics who said that a community of radically varying ethnicities and languages who were territorially intertwined with other communities could not be a nation, the theory said that the concept of nation in the East was different from that in the West. In the East, religion was ‘a complete social order which affects all the activities in life’ and ‘where the allegiance of people is divided on the basis of religion, the idea of territorial nationalism has never succeeded’. To guarantee the Muslim population of the South Asian subcontinent will not be dominated by Hindus and to guarantee they will have a place in society, it would be under our best interests to assert our hegemony in the area and create a nation for all Muslims in South Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

found_dar_es_salaam_desc;Mzizima (Kiswahili for ‘healthy town’) is a coastal fishing village on the periphery of Indian Ocean trade routes. In $YEAR$, the ruler of $COUNTRY$ came up with an ambitious plan to try and transform this small fishing village in a major trade port in the Indian Ocean: founding a new city, built to be bigger and more grandiose than anything on this corner of the Swahili Coast. This plan also includes building new palaces so the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ ruler has a place to rest. This in part inspired the name chosen for the city: Dar Es Salaam or the ‘abode of peace’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
found_ottawa_desc;Bytown, located near the Ottawa river, has grown to become an important centre of trade in Canada. Located where the Rideau Canal meets the Ottawa River, it consists of two parts cantered around the canal: Upper Town, situated to the west of the canal and Lower Town on the east side of the canal. The two areas of town are connected over the Rideau Canal by the Sappers Bridge, constructed in 1827. A proposal came forward to expand the city through minor annexations and to, in the end, incorporate it with a new name-Ottawa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
founding_yadanabon_desc;In $YEAR$, King Mindon of $COUNTRY$ ordered a new royal capital to be built at the foot of Mandalay Hill in order to fulfil a prophecy on the founding of a metropolis of Buddhism in that exact place on the occasion of the 2,400th jubilee of Buddhism. The new capital city site was 66 sq. km in area, surrounded by four rivers. The plan called for a 144-square block grid patterned citadel, anchored by a 16 square block royal palace compound at the centre by Mandalay Hill. The 1020-acre citadel was to be surrounded by four 2,032 m long walls and a moat 64 m wide, 4.6 m deep. At intervals of 169 m along the wall, turrets were built with gold-tipped spires for watchmen. The walls had three gates on each side, and five bridges to cross the moat. In addition, the king also commissioned the Kuthodaw Pagoda, the Pahtan-haw Shwe Thein upasampada hall, the Thudamma ‘Good Dharma’ zayats or public houses for preaching Buddhism and a library for the Pali Canon. The former royal palace of Amarapura was dismantled and moved by elephants to the new location at the foot of Mandalay. This new city would be named Yadanabon-City of Gems, a reference to the Valley of Rubies, 200 km to the north in the Mogok mountains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Under French control 1682 to 1762 and 1802 (nominally) to 1803, the area was named in honour of King Louis XIV, by French explorer Rene-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle. While France lost the territory during the Seven Years’ War, France regained sovereignty of the western territory in the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso of 1800. But strained by obligations in Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte decided to sell the territory to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, ending France’s presence in Louisiana.\n\nAttempting to reconquer the vast territory of Louisiana will be a monumental task…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

pressburg_rename_ger_desc;The city received its contemporary name in 1919. Until then, it was mostly known in English by its German name, Preßburg, since after 1526 it was dominated mostly by the Habsburg Monarchy and the city had a relevant ethnic-German population. That is the term from which the pre-1919 Slovak (Prešporok) name is derived. The city’s Hungarian name, Pozsony, was given after the castle’s first castellan, ‘Poson’. The origin of the name is unclear. During the revolution of 1918-1919, the name ‘Wilsonov’ or ‘Wilsonstadt’ (after President Woodrow Wilson) was proposed by American Slovaks, as he supported national self-determination. The name Bratislava, which had been used only by some Slovak patriots, became official in March 1919 with the aim that a Slavic name could support the demands that the city should be part of Czechoslovakia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

russian_vladivostok_desc;In July of 1860 the port of Vladivostok, or ‘Ruler of the East’, was founded near the Korean frontier. It would become a major Russian trade port and shipbuilding yard. Eventually, it would become the focal point of an intercontinental railroad as well as a major scientific, cultural, and industrial centre in its own right. The Czar dreamed that the city would become a hub connecting the west with the east. Perhaps the railroad to Vladivostok will eventually replace the Suez Canal as the bearer of goods and raw materials between the East and the West?;En juillet 1860, le port de Vladivostok, «le maître de l’Orient» en Russe, fut fondé près de la frontière coréenne. Il deviendra un des principaux ports et chantiers navals de Russie. La ville finira par devenir le point central d’un réseau ferroviaire intercontinental ainsi qu’une grande capitale scientifique, culturelle et industrielle. Le tsar rêvait d’en faire une passerelle entre l'Occident et l'Orient. Peut-être qu’un jour, le chemin de fer de Vladivostok remplacera-t-il le canal de Suez dans l’acheminement des marchandises et des matières premières entre l’Orient et l’Occident?;"Im Juli 1869 wurde der Hafen von Wladiwostok, oder auch ""Der Herrscher des Ostens"" nahe der koreanischen Grenze eingeweiht. Er entwickelte sich im Laufe der Zeit zu einem wichtigen Handelshafen und Werftstandort für Russland. Schließlich wurde Wladiwostok zum Mittelpunkt einer interkontinentalen Eisenbahnstrecke sowie zu einem eigenständigen Wissenschafts-, Kultur- und Industriezentrum.

russian_vladivostokSOV_desc;In July of 1860 the port of Vladivostok, or ‘Ruler of the East’, was founded near the Korean frontier. It would become a major Russian trade port and shipbuilding yard. Eventually, it would become the focal point of an intercontinental railroad as well as a major scientific, cultural, and industrial centre in its own right. The Czar dreamed that the city would become a hub connecting the west with the east. Perhaps the railroad to Vladivostok will eventually replace the Suez Canal as the bearer of goods and raw materials between the East and the West?;En juillet 1860, le port de Vladivostok, «le maître de l’Orient» en Russe, fut fondé près de la frontière coréenne. Il deviendra un des principaux ports et chantiers navals de Russie. La ville finira par devenir le point central d’un réseau ferroviaire intercontinental ainsi qu’une grande capitale scientifique, culturelle et industrielle. Le tsar rêvait d’en faire une passerelle entre l'Occident et l'Orient. Peut-être qu’un jour, le chemin de fer de Vladivostok remplacera-t-il le canal de Suez dans l’acheminement des marchandises et des matières premières entre l’Orient et l’Occident?;"Im Juli 1869 wurde der Hafen von Wladiwostok, oder auch ""Der Herrscher des Ostens"" nahe der koreanischen Grenze eingeweiht. Er entwickelte sich im Laufe der Zeit zu einem wichtigen Handelshafen und Werftstandort für Russland. Schließlich wurde Wladiwostok zum Mittelpunkt einer interkontinentalen Eisenbahnstrecke sowie zu einem eigenständigen Wissenschafts-, Kultur- und Industriezentrum. Der Zar träumte davon, dass die Stadt der Hauptverbindungspunkt zwischen Ost und West werden würde. Vielleicht wird Wladiwostok schließlich sogar den Suezkanal als Haupttransportader von Gütern und Rohmaterialien zwischen der östlichen und westlichen Hemisphäre ersetzen?";;;;;;;;;;;x

russification_of_finland_desc;Having enjoyed prosperity and control over their own affairs, and having remained loyal subjects for nearly a century, the manifesto which the $MONARCHTITLE$ issued on $YEAR$ was cause for Finnish despair. The manifesto was forced through the Finnish senate by the deciding vote of the senate president, an appointee of the $MONARCHTITLE$-and after the governor-general of Finland, Nikolay Bobrikov, had threatened a military invasion and siege. While ostensibly affirming the Finns’ rights in purely local matters, the manifesto asserted the authority of the state in any and all matters which could be considered to ‘come within the scope of the general legislation of the empire’. The main policies enacted were:\nThe conscription law, incorporating the Finnish army into the imperial army.\nThe Language Manifesto of $YEAR$ which made Russian the language of administration of Finland.\nThe Orthodox Russian Church was the church of state, including, for example, criminalizing the act of subjecting a follower of the Orthodox church to a Lutheran church service.\nThe Manifesto of $YEAR$ which asserted the imperial government’s right to rule Finland without the consent of local legislative bodies, including press censorship and restrictions of Russian currency and stamps as the only ones allowed.\nOur Finnish subjects will surely not like this and they might try to resist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

russify_baltic_states_desc;The Russian press took up the topic of German influence in the Baltic provinces. As early as the 1860s, the Slavophiles demanded the end of the autonomy in the Baltic provinces and a standardized administration. The unification of Germany and its subsequent development into a Great Power considerably increased the military-strategic importance of the Estonian and Latvian territories which bordered the Baltic Sea, between the extensively autonomous Finland and the rebellious Poland-Lithuania. The security of the capital St Petersburg became a serious issue for the Russian Empire. Tsarist Russia’s government circles were afraid of the Baltic German’s possible orientation towards Germany, especially worrying was the thought that by Germanizing the Estonians and Latvians, the Germans could become the majority nation in the Baltics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tasmania_penal_colony_desc;In 1803 the island south of Australia was colonized by the British as a penal colony with the name Van Diemen’s Land, and became part of the British colony of New South Wales. Male convicts served their sentences as assigned labour to free settlers or in gangs assigned to public works. Only the most difficult convicts (mostly re-offenders) were sent to the Tasman Peninsula prison known as Port Arthur. Female convicts were assigned as servants in free settler households or sent to a female factory (women’s workhouse prison). There were five female factories in Van Diemen’s Land. Convicts completing their sentences or earning their ticket-of-leave often promptly left Van Diemen’s Land. Many settled in the new free colony of Victoria, to the dismay of the free settlers in towns such as Melbourne.\n\nWe can abolish the penal colony and convert the island to a regular colony. Changing the name to Tasmania from Van Diemen’s Land should help our government to clear a little bit of the stigma that the island has.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

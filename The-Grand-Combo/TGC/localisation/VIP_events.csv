EVTNAME101532;The Ruthenian Triad Publishes 'The Mermaid of the Dniester';;;;;;;;;;x;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC101532;In 1837, the so-called Ruthenian Triad led by Markiyan Shashkevych, published 'The Mermaid of the Dniester', a collection of folksongs and other materials in the common Ruthenian tongue. Alarmed by such democratism, the authorities and the Greek Catholic Metropolitan sought to ban the book.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,
EVTOPTA101532;Ban the book!;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB101532;Let them have their book;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME101533;Lajos Kossuth Released;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC101533;A prominent Hungarian liberal, Lajos Kossuth, has finally been released from jail, along with other notable liberals. Since his release he has become something of a national hero to many Hungarians, and he has continued his opposition towards our government. As the editor of the Pesti Hirlap he has talked about the great economic and societal problems within Hungary, advocated full national autonomy within the Habsburg Empire, the immediate emancipation of the serfs - with no compensation to aristocrats - and an end of noble privileges. He has also promoted industrialization by founding the Gyáralapito és Kereskedelmi Társaság (Factory-Founding and Commercial Society).;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,
EVTOPTA101533;Another mouthpiece for the nationalists...;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME101534;End the Publication of the Pesti Hirlap?;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC101534;We have tried to put an end to Kossuth’s hostility to our rule for some time now. His criticism of our rule in Hungary is highly influential and therefore highly damaging for us. His chief political weapon is a liberal rag, the Pesti Hirlap, in which he has been able to express his radical views. Perhaps if we were to purchase the newspaper we could put an end to Kossuth’s ramblings?;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTA101534;We must stop this anti-government drivel!;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB101534;Let it continue to circulate;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME101535;Hungarian Moderates Sidelined;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC101535;By our refusal to ratify reforms that many Hungarians have wanted since 1825, we've sidelined the moderates who wanted reforms but no national autonomy. Kossuth's articles against us in the Pesti Hirlap were the last straw and now the radicals, especially Kossuth, hold the love of the people and more importantly, the majority in Parliament. The Hungarians will not settle for anything less than an autonomous national government. Széchényi István, the very man who started the call for reforms in 1825, writes articles attacking the Pesti Hirlap and Kossuth himself, and together with the moderates, they either join the radicals or like Széchényi drift towards the conservatives. There is now no middle ground in Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x
EVTNAME101536;Frantisek Palacky and the Czech National Revival;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC101536;Considered one of the fathers of modern Czech nation, Palacky played a leading role in the Czech cultural and national revival of the early nineteenth century. At first a proponent of Austro-Slavism, a view that advocated unification and autonomy of Slavs within the framework of the Habsburg monarchy, Palacky later called for complete Czech independence. Palacky's greatest literary contribution was his History of Bohemia, which significantly influenced growing Czech national consciousness as it saw the history of Bohemia as a constant struggle of Germans and Slavs.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,
EVTNAME101537;France Preseren and the Slovenian National Awakening;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC101537;A key figure in the development of Slovene nationalism, Preseren led a movement to promote the use of Slovene instead of German at a time when Slovene was dismissed by the Austrian ruling elite as a peasant language, and was not taught in schools. A skilled poet, his works include Zdravljica, which was censored at the time for its national and pan-Slavic message.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,
##### Brazil #####;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME116303;The Great Drought of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC116303;In $YEAR$ the worst drought ever recorded afflicted the Northeast of Brazil. The result would be a massive emigration of peasants to new areas, such as the Amazonian city of Manaus which was becoming wealthy due to the start of the Rubber Boom.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,,,,

EVTDESC146604;First appearing during the second half of the 19th century among the popular classes of Buenos Aires, tango became a cultural institution in Argentina. More than a dance, tango became a sign of the Argentine desire to afirm their own identity. Melancholic, very moving and expressive, it became famous around the world and Argentina became 'el pais del tango'.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,
EVTOPTA146604;Bailamos!!;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME131509;The Czech National Theater;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131509;The Czech National Theater is the embodiment of the will of the Czech nation for it's national identity and independence. Collections of money among the broad masses of the people facilitated it's construction, and so the ceremonious laying of the foundation stone on the 16th of May,$YEAR$, was tantamount to an all-state political demonstration. The Czech National Theater was opened for the first time on the 11th of June,1881, to honour the visit of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,
EVTOPTA131509;A testament to the achievements of the Czech nation!;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131510;The Splitting of Charles University;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131510;Gradually, as Czechs became more prosperous and more literate, significant advances were made - particularly in the use of the Czech language in education and in courts of law. In $YEAR$, the Czech departments in the long-established German university in Prague voted to become a separate and independent Czech-speaking university.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,,

EVTOPTB131510;Refuse to split the university;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131511;Theodor Herzl's 'Der Judenstaat';;;;;;;;;;x;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131511;'Der Judenstaat' ('The State of the Jews') was a book written by the Jewish journalist Theodor Herzl, and it was published in 1896 in Leipzig and Vienna. As expressed in this book, Herzl envisioned the founding of a future independent Jewish state during the 20th century, noting the possibility of forming such a state in Argentina. It is considered one of the most important texts of early Zionism, indeed much popularizing the term 'Zionism' which was originally coined by the Jewish thinker Nathan Birnbaum.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,
EVTOPTA131511;An independent state for the Jews? Madness!;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131512;The Stanczyks;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131512;In 1869 a group of young conservative publicists: Jozef Szujski, Stanislaw Tarnowski, Stanislaw Kozmian and Ludwik Wodzicki, published a series of satirical pamphlets entitled 'Teka Stanczyka' ('Stanczyk's Portfolio'). Only five years after the tragic end of the January Uprising, the pamphlets ridiculed the idea of armed national uprisings and suggested a compromise with Poland's enemies, especially the Austrian Empire, and more concentration on economic growth than on political independence. The political faction which adopted these ideas became known as 'Stanczycy' (plural of 'Stanczyk').;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,
EVTOPTA131512;Loyalty to Vienna!;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC131513;A Croatian Bishop, in 1874 Strossmayer published a tract which detailed his ideas on South Slavic national and political unification. Calling his ideology Yugoslavism, Strossmayer drew from the earlier ideas of Illyrianism the goal of unification of South Slavs in an independant federation. Strossmayer's ideas gained support among the Croat and Serb liberal bourgeoisie and young radicals, and soon Croat and Serb politicans in the Empire began to espose the ideals of the movement.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,,

EVTNAME146304;The Influence of Positivism;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC146304;Based on the idea that the state should use rationalism and science to help society progress and develop, even at the expense of challenging traditional powers and values, the ideals of Positivism gained a great deal of support in Brazilian society, especially among military officers who resented the inability of Brazil's political elite to put tradition and privilege aside for the benefit of the nation as a whole. Some began to suggest that the military should overthrow the imperial system and promote the regeneration of Brazilian society based on positivist goals.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTA146304;Ordem e Progresso;;;;;;;;;;X;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME146305;Dom Pedro II Weds;;;;;;;;;;x;;;x,,,,,,,,

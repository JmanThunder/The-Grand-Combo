TIT198260501;Diego Portales.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260501;Diego Portales was a Chilean statesman and entrepreneur who played a pivotal role in shaping the chilean state and government politics in the 19th century, delivering with the Constitution of 1833 the framework of the Chilean state for almost a century. Portales influential political stance included unitarianism, presidentialism and conservatism which led to consolidate Chile as a constitutional authoritarian republic with democracy restricted to include only upper class men.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260502;Diego Portales has been assassinated!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260502;The war against our northern neighboors was not welcomed by all in Chile. Instead of promoting national unity, the liberals have used the war to critizise Portales and his ruling policy. Last week he had ordered the execution of 3 liberals in the town of Curicó, and today a rebel group of soldiers captures Portales and executed him in Quillota. The whole country is in chaos and expecting us to make an official statement. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260503;Revolution is in the air.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260503;The resignation and self-exile of General Bernardo O'Higgins in 1823 did not put an end to the chilean political infighting. The Chilean political scene divided itself into two groups that were already embrionary during the independence days. One group was mainly composed by the remains of the colonial aristocracy, and defended the ideas of a strong central government, respect of tradition and a strong support for the Catholic Church called the Pelucones. And on the other end of the spectrum we had the Pipiolos who proposed a small government and freedom of trade. Now that the Pipiolos  and liberals are gaining more power they have started to push major social reforms, polarizing the population. The Pelucones have control of the newspapers are using them to push the situation to a boiling point. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260504;A new constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260504;After almost three years of assassination attempts and hurling insults at each other, the chilean political parties have agreed to sit down and find an agreement. From this agreement we will write a new Constitution that will put an end to the chilean civil war and will hopefully be one of the most long-lived constitutions of Latin America. Representatives from all parties have made sure that it can be used to endorse both an authoritarian presidentialist system or an oligarchic parliamentary system down the road. What kind of government do the chileans need?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260505;La cuestión del sacristán.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260505;Bishop Rafael Valdivieso, dean of the Metropolitan Cathedral of Santiago, fired a sacristan named Pedro Santelices. Apparently he invited some friends for a meeting at the parrish, but the Holy Wine got the better of them and a stone destroyed the skylight! However, Pedro raised the issue to the religious tribunal of La Serena, who ruled in his favor. Unhappy with the result, the Bishop is now seeking our support to intervene since he's going to raise the issue to The Supreme Court of Justice. Intervening will have political consequences, but it will appease the ecclesiastic authorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260506;Loss of support.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260506;Many chileans are outraged by your support of the Bishop in what most see as a religious matter. Even your own supporters are critizing your administration for not respecting the separation of the powers of the State and allowing the Church to openly question the Supreme Court. The issue is all over the newspapers and our political party has been permanently divided and radicalized. You have lost the support of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260507;Ley de inmigración selectiva.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260507;The port of Valparaíso has become one of the most important centers of commerce in the southern hemisphere. It is the first major port after the dangerous Cape Horn that unites the Atlantic of the Pacific and most immigrant ships stay there for a few days before resuming their travel north. Vicente Pérez Rosales, one of our brightest advisors, has devised an innovative plan to convince them to settle in southern Chile instead of continue their travel. Other countries may not be happy about us implementing this policy, but it's well worth the risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260508;Siempre vencedor, jamás vencido.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260508;Our neighboors seem to have forgotten how bravely we fought by their side against the spanish, and some are suggesting that it's because our army is falling behind in the arms race. One of our officers insists that a reminder of our might is long overdue, and tells us that the british have developed a new type of gun that greatly outmatches anything we have seen on this side of the ocean. He also mentioned that there's several british investors who feel than an armed Chile is in their best interest as well. Unless we want to change the army's motto, we should make this investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260509;The Liberal Revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260509;A lot have changed since the Civil War tore our country apart decades ago. While the new constitution did bring the reforms the people wanted, there's a liberal minority that feel the current government's constant political persecution is unaccetable. Arms re being stolen regularily from some our supply depots, and we suspect some officers may be involved. We could try to avert the problem by siding with the radical faction, but going against the ruling party is going to make us look weak.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TIT198260510;The Liberation of Perú.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260510;Following the Battle of Maipú and the subsequent liberation of Chile, the Ejército Libertador began the preparations for an amphibious assault force to liberate Peru. Originally the costs were to be assumed by both Chile and Argentina, however our government ended up assuming most of costs of the campaign since Bernardo O'Higgins was convinced that Chile would never be safe until Perú was free of the Spanish yoke. It was determined that the chilean-argentinian land army was going to be led by José de San Martín, whilst the navy was to be commanded by admiral "lord" Thomas Alexander Cochrane while Bernardo O'Higgins would remain in Chile as Supreme Director of the Republic. We will not stop until all our latinamerican brothers are free! We will live with honor or die with glory! Those who are brave will follow!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
liberation_of_mendoza_title;The liberation of Mendoza;;;;;;;;;;;;x #true story brah. To this day, they are still mocked by porteños for their "chilean" accent.
liberation_of_mendoza_desc;Mendoza was founded by chileans and remained part of the Capitanía General de Chile under spanish rule for over two centuries. Later, when the Virreinato de La Plata was created on 1776 Chile and all it's lands were transferred to the argentinans. At this point Buenos Aires decided that Mendoza and all of our land east of the Andes would remain under argentinian rule. Today, we have reverted this decision. From now on we will march with our mendocinian brothers. Once again we will fight for freedom side by side under the same flag.;;;;;;;;;;;x

conquest_of_atacama_desc;The desert of Atacama is finally under chilean control. While most of the population is very happy to be under our benevolous rule, large amounts of bolivians and peruvians make no attempt to conceal their contempt and some even dare to question our right to hold these lands. In light of the current events, we have decided that all citizens are forbidden to celebrate foreign holdays and shall sing our national anthem before any public act. They will all become chilean, by reason or by force.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1000200;Now that we are powerful enough to hold our own, an important matter rose up regarding our role in the Eastern Christendom. It is a well-known fact that the Byzantine Empire for a long time was the centre of the Orthodox Church and the Eastern Christendom as a whole. Sadly, we’ve lost our authority and power due to numerous wars and raids and our title as the protector was taken by another powerful Orthodox nation known as the Russian Empire. We are glad that they’ve been doing our work for centuries now, but it’s time that we take this title back since it’s supposed to be us that should protect the Eastern Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1000200;The New Protector of Eastern Christians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000201;We’ve been notified that the newly restored Byzantine Empire seeks to reclaim its title as the Orthodox Protector.

EVTNAME1000201;The Orthodox Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000202;The fools of The Russian Empire refuted our rightful claim on the title of the Orthodox Protector. The title is ours by definition and they will pay for denying us our claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1010011;For years, British committees have looked into the situation in Ireland and predicted disaster: the Irish farmers had become more and more dependent on their potato crop, and if anything were to happen to that crop it would cause not only widespread chaos throughout the Irish economy but famine and worse. Their predictions have come true. A blight has been spreading, leading to failure after failure of the Irish potato harvest. Proponents of laissez-faire economics are adamant that the market will provide food for those affected, and that the government should not interfere in private enterprise. Others claim that no expense is too high to help the Irish, and that failure to act quickly will lead to starvation and resentment… but conservatives are quick to dismiss this as inflammatory nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1010015;An aborted attempt at an uprising recently took place in the village of Ballingarry, Ireland. A group of Irish nationalists, frustrated by what they call the inept handling of the recent famine by the British government, engaged in a long gunfight with a unit of constabulary until reinforcements arrived and drove the men off. Many of these nationalists have since been captured and tried, but the event has sparked an increase in nationalism across the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA1010015;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010016;Not content to wait until the dust of the war has settled, nationalists in Ireland have taken to the streets of $PROVINCENAME$ to call for the end of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. With our forces engaged elsewhere, their calls have quickly swept across all of $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA1010016;When the war is done, there shall be consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010020;The tone among the people in our Irish territories has changed. Many Irish nationalist who emigrated to the United States founded a militant organization called the Fenian Brotherhood there, a group dedicated to freeing Ireland from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control… and now they have formed a sister organization back home, the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Already they are stirring up trouble, and it seems certain they will continue until some manner of home rule is attained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1010020;The Irish Republican Brotherhood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1010020;Perhaps the time has come to examine the Irish situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010021;We’ve received reports that the Irish Republican Brotherhood has been active in $PROVINCENAME$, spreading propaganda and generally stirring up agitation against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government.

EVTOPTA1010021;This is a serious issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1010023;In an event organized by the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a group of Irish nationalists seized key locations in the city of $PROVINCENAME$ on Easter Monday, kicking off the most significant uprising in Ireland since the rebellion of 1798.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1010024;Spurred on by increased public sympathy towards the Irish Republican Brotherhood following the Easter Rising, the Sinn Féin have won a majority of seats in Ireland during the last election. They have gathered in Dublin and declared themselves Dáil Éireann, the parliament of Ireland, and demanded that Ireland be granted immediate full independence. Considering their popularity, refusing would all but certainly trigger a war… but many agree that this is not the way to a peaceful resolution, and that $COUNTRY$ should never submit to such demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1010024;The Sinn Féin Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1010024;We will not be negotiated with at gunpoint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1010024;Grant them independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010025;With Ireland once again under our control, talks have begun in earnest to deal with the Irish situation once and for all… now on our terms, rather than on theirs. The suggestion is that Ireland remain an autonomous Dominion under our control, with any regions that wish to opt out of the new state and remain part of $COUNTRY$ able to do so. Others suggest this is unworkable, and we should either simply release them and keep them as allies or annex them entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1010030;An Anglo-Irish politician by the name of Charles Stewart Parnell has just been elected to Parliament. Some are describing him as a firebrand and nationalist agitator, while others suggest he’s a man of remarkable charisma and organizational talent-able to take on the entirety of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political system in order to push his Irish Home Rule agenda and succeed. It’s very possible that this man could single-handedly turn the tide of opinion on the subject of Home Rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA1010030;Keep him contained. We don’t want trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1010031;With Charles Stewart Parnell putting forward his Home Rule agenda, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens in $PROVINCENAME$ have become increasingly concerned that they might end up in an independent Irish state-one dominated by Irish Catholics in Dublin. They have begun actively campaigning to ensure this doesn’t happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA1010031;Yet more trouble in Ireland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010032;Charles Stewart Parnell has been successfully advancing his Home Rule Bill through Parliament, and while it is continually being held up by opposition from the Upper House, there is a sense that the man is managing to convince $COUNTRY_ADJ$ law-makers who-in the not-too-distant past-might have said that Home Rule was unthinkable. \n \n Now we must consider whether his vision will see the light of day: do we grant Ireland the status of an autonomous Dominion under our control, or put this aside and face renewed violence among the Irish? Either way, this man Parnell will not desist, and the question will keep coming before us even if we do not pass the Bill now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1010032;Irish Home Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1010032;Pass the bill and give them Home Rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC1010032;Onward to Ireland! (Play as Ireland);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010033;The revelation that Charles Stewart Parnell has been involved with a married woman, one Catherine O’Shea, and indeed is responsible for her subsequent divorce, was the scandal that ended his political career and prevented him from pushing the Home Rule agenda. Without him, it appears unlikely that the Irish Republican movement will gain the political clout it requires to attempt another passing of the Home Rule Bill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA1010033;Unfortunate. For the Irish, I mean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010034;Enclosure is the legal process of enclosing a number of small landholdings to create one larger farm. Once enclosed, use of the land became restricted to the owner, and it ceased to be common land for communal use. This results in less land for the people to cultivate. This, coupled with overpopulation in Ireland, contributed much to poverty in the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1100540;The Blackshirts were established as the squadristi in 1919 and consisted of many disgruntled former soldiers.

In 1922 the squadristi were reorganized into the milizia and formed numerous bandiere, and on 1 February 1923 the Blackshirts became the Voluntary Militia for National Security, which lasted until the 8 September 1943 Armistice of Cassibile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME1100541;Rise of Blackshirts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1100542;In the night between 27 and 28 October 1922, about 30,000 Fascist Blackshirts gathered in Rome to demand the resignation of liberal Prime Minister Luigi Facta and the appointment of a new Fascist government. On the morning of 28 October, King Victor Emmanuel III, who according to the Albertine Statute held the supreme military power, refused the government request to declare martial law, which led to Facta’s resignation.

Although Tsar Nicholas personally read the poem, and was quite amused at the parts attacking him, he purportedly flew into a rage when the poem attacked his wife.

EVTDESC3498620;With the Ottoman government having indicated its willingness to provide reforms, an intellectual class known as the Young Ottomans has arisen-men influenced by the ideals of the French Revolution who are advocating the assumption of secular rather than religious laws as well as the provision of rights to ethnic minorities. This, they say, will help stem the tide of decay in the Empire. Most recently they have suggested embracing the Empire’s Bulgarian minorities, maintaining that such a gesture would indicate a willingness to embrace European values. Mashriqi citizens have gotten wind of this, demanding that they as Muslims should receive preferential treatment.

Flores surrendered on his plantation, La Elvira, near Babahoyo and accepted a negotiation-which had terms including his leaving power and the declaration of all his decrees, laws, and acts as void and null, ending fifteen years of foreign domination in Ecuador. Flores received 20,000 pesos for his property and immediately left the country for Spain.

It was so colossal that a team of 16 horses was needed to pull the wagon upon which it rested from the foundry to the Tower. The transportation took on the character of a parade, with enthusiastic crowds lining the streets as the caravan made its way through London. The bell and tower got nicknamed ‘Big Ben’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

His first step was to persuade the Matabele King Lobengula to sign a treaty giving him rights to mining and administration (but not settlement as such) in the area of Mashonaland which was ruled by the King by use of coercion and murderous raids involved tribute-taking and abduction of young men and women. Using his Concession between Rhodes’ British South Africa Company and Lobengula, he then sought and obtained a charter from the British government allowing him to act.

Although the most logical action would be to incorporate Alaska as a territory of the United States, some argue this would be imperialistic in nature and infringe upon the rights of population in Alaska. The majority Inuit population shows no interest in state building, and the small European Alaskan population is so small that it would not take long for American settlers to outnumber them.

The Unitarians, sympathetic to our government, fled Argentina in exile after being defeated in 1831. Rosas, the so-called Restorer of the Laws, controlled the Argentina Confederation for too long under his despotic rule.

After a dubious land purchase from Maori he established the Nanto-Bordelaise Company in France to carry out the project, and in 1839, King Louis-Philippe agreed to provide assistance. The French representative for the settlement, Captain Charles François Lavaud, sailed for New Zealand in April 1840. A month later, the ship Comte de Paris set off for Akaroa carrying 53 emigrants.

EVTDESC7790100;With the Rhineland back under French control, the question has been raised as to what to do with the new ‘French’ subjects. Despite the German nature of the West Bank, The Rhinelanders had not been enemies of Revolutionary France, unlike the Spaniards or Portuguese. Prussia, even after their incorporation of the Rhineland and Westphalia in 1815, were regarded by the Rhinelanders with more suspicion, due to their Francophile feeling. The incorporation of such a large number of non-French citizens has also brought up France’s cultural diversity in other areas of the Empire, such as in Algeria or Flanders. Some of the more conservative politicians call for a purely French state, united in one language and culture. The Liberals, however, call for granting the Rhinelanders autonomy similar to that of the Walloons. While Autonomy will seriously hinder our assimilation efforts, it may reduce unrest in the Rhineland and prevent giving the Germans reason to intervene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC7790101;French rule over the Rhineland has been firmly cemented in the last 15 years. The Rhenish autonomy laws, as well as the cultural exchange between the Rhineland and the rest of France, has finally earned the loyalty of the Rhenish people.

EVTDESC8003006;Final years of Allende’s presidency were marred by political scandals, mainly revolving around the allegations that Allende—surrounded by KGB advisors—had turned Chile into a centre for Soviet operations in Latin America. The nationalization of U.S. and other foreign-owned companies led to increased tensions with the United States. As a result, the Richard Nixon administration organized and inserted secret operatives and exercised economic pressure in Chile, in order to quickly destabilize Allende’s government. By 1972, the economic progress of Allende’s first year had been reversed, and the economy was in crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

A domestic Barbary macaque belonging to the steward of the palace’s grapevines attacked or was attacked by the king’s German Shepherd Dog, Fritz, and Alexander attempted to separate the two animals. As he did so, another monkey attacked Alexander and bit him deeply on the leg and torso. Eventually servants arrived and chased away the monkeys, and the king’s wounds were promptly cleaned and dressed but not cauterized. He did not consider the incident serious and asked that it not be publicized. That evening, his wounds became infected-he suffered a strong fever and sepsis set in. His doctors considered amputating his leg, but none wished to take responsibility for so drastic an act. On 19 October, he became delirious and called out for his mother, but the Greek government refused to allow her to re-enter the country from exile in Switzerland, despite her own protestations. Finally, the queen dowager, Olga, George I’s widow and Alexander’s grandmother, was allowed to return alone to Athens to tend to the king. She was delayed by rough waters, however, and by the time she arrived, Alexander had already died of sepsis twelve hours previously at a little after 4 p.m. on 25 October 1920.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC9990026;The Norman crown stands at the end of its golden age, defeated 20 years ago in the Grand Coalition it has been stripped of the title Holy Roman Emperor and much of its influence. Burgundy, once a province is now a nation. The Archduke of Guyenne, once a loyal vassal now pursues his own interests and the boards of the great trading companies of the east now serve no master aside from profits. Though Normandy is still a great power, perhaps the greatest, this sense of decline has lifted the spirits of nationalists on both sides of the channel. This is the dawning of a new age and only time will tell if it belongs to Normandy as the last did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990027;BLOOD AND THUNDER!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC9990034;Our glorious republic has come into its own as of late, born through fire 50 years ago we now stand as the bastion of liberty and freedom in the world. Our people prosper and though divided by language and religion they remain united by revolutionary ideals.

Let us liberate our brothers under the Norman yoke and rule this land in the name of freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990035;We stand at the deciding moment of what will surely go down as world changing debate, many voices among the senior knights have pointed to the massive settlement of Arabs from the east coast in our lands to say that our long standing policies to convert, educate and ultimately protect the natives are now pointless, that we must now more than ever use the bounties of the new world to secure a homeland for Christian Greeks. Others claim that that same Arab migration merely cements the need for our missionary work. Whichever argument proves more persuasive the consequences for the future of this land will be great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9990036;Though successful in our quest to establish a modern state at the expense of the colonial powers the challenge of building a nation is far from over and the many native peoples of our lands are slow to accept the French language and modern ideals given to us by the Knights.

The purpose of the campaign was to reunify China, which had become fragmented in the aftermath of the Revolution of 1911. The expedition was led by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and was divided into two phases. The first phase ended in a 1927 political split between two factions of the KMT. The right-leaning Nanjing faction, led by Chiang, and the left-leaning faction in Wuhan, led by Wang Jingwei. The split was partially motivated by Chiang’s purging of communists within the KMT, which marked the end of the First United Front. In an effort to mend this schism, Chiang Kai-shek stepped down as the commander of the NRA in August 1927, and went into exile in Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Following the incident, conservative KMT elements carried out a full-scale purge of Communists in all areas under their control, and even more violent suppression occurred in Guangzhou and Changsha. The purge led to an open split between left—and right-wing factions in the KMT, with Chiang Kai-shek establishing himself as the leader of the right-wing faction based in Nanjing, in opposition to the original left-wing KMT government based in Wuhan led by Wang Jingwei.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After Nat Turner was captured and the rebellion ended, over a hundred slaves were massacred in retaliation. For many in New Africa, Nat Turner represents the heroism and determination needed to fight such a brutal system like slavery. However, whites in the country perceive Nat Turner as a violent murderer.

However, the character of Uncle Remus has received a very mixed reaction from black New Africans. While it is impossible to ignore the rich collection of folklore Harris has been able to compile, there are many, especially among the intellectual class, who are critical of what they believe to be a romanticizing of slavery and accuse Harris of cultural theft. The New African government can either curtail the distribution of Harris’s work or allow it circulate openly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132231;Born into bondage in 1818, Fredrick Douglass escaped slavery at a young age and fled from Maryland to New Africa. He has quickly gained notoriety for his skill as an orator and controversy for his staunch support of racial and gender equality. While most in New Africa view him as the country’s most important statesman, few entirely embrace his radical proposal for the greater social and political integration of whites in New Africa. However, his most recent publication, A Narrative of New Africa, has enticed many New Africans into his Equality Party and led to an increased acceptance of the notion for greater equality among the races.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132232;The legend of John Henry is the tale of one man with raw strength and incredible endurance beating a steam-powered machine in a competition to drill a tunnel through a mountain. Although where precisely this competition occurred and whether if such a man even existed is debatable, there is no denying that John Henry has become an inspiring symbol of the industrial New African man. Additionally, his hammer-wielding image has become closely associated with socialist parties and trade unions, especially those composed of railway workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC44132233;Prominent academic and founder of the Tuskegee Institute Booker T. Washington has always been known as a moderate voice in New African politics, and he frequently opposes war waged at the expense of various domestic reforms, especially those related to education. Washington recently gave a speech to a large crowd in $CAPITAL$. In the speech, he called for the development of greater respect and the reduction of tensions between whites and blacks in New Africa. Furthermore, Washington argued for better relations between New Africa and the United States and proposed a compromise in which New Africa would cease territorial expansion into the American South in return for an increase in trade and protection from the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The treaty would establish the border from the Rio Negro north-westward along the Amazon River-Orinoco watershed divide, then generally southward along various river courses and straight-line segments to the mouth of the Apaporis River.

EVTDESC146610102;When Bolivia became independent from Spain on 1825, it took possession of the territories that corresponded to its colonial administration in accordance with the uti possidetis juris of 1810. Bolivia claimed the maritime territory westward from the Andes to the Pacific Ocean between the Rio Salado on the south and the Rio Loa on the north, which included part of the Atacama Desert. Later in the mid-19th century, Chile made claims to the desert area following the discovery and exploitation of nitrate deposits and the move en masse of its population to work in the new found richness in Antofagasta. Because of that, the following decades were witness to much bloodshed on the borders of Bolivia, Peru and Chile. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has put a proposal, with international approval, to solve this problem amicably and set terms for new borders, paying indemnities for all involved. Regional powers set their eyes on us, expecting our reaction and the consequences for the future of the region of Antofagasta.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC746610102;By 1895 $COUNTRY$ had had a dispute with a neighbour about the territory of Guayana Esequiba for over half a century. The territorial claims were originally those of the Spanish Empire (inherited by $COUNTRY$ after its independence in 1830) and of the Dutch Empire (with the acquisition of the Dutch territories of Essequibo, Demerara and Berbice in 1814), having remained unsettled over previous centuries. The basis of the dispute is the advocacy of a particular division of the territory deriving from a mid-nineteenth-century survey commissioned by the country that owns Guyana. This division is known as the ‘Schomburgk Line ‘, after the German naturalist who surveyed the territory. In October 1886 they declared the Line to be the provisional frontier of Guiana with $COUNTRY$, and in February 1887 $COUNTRY$ severed diplomatic relations. The discovery of gold in El Callao in $COUNTRY$ heated up the dispute, with several foreigners crossing the frontier to find gold. The situation changed after we obtained the services of William L. Scruggs, former US Ambassador to Colombia and Venezuela. We can use him as a lobbyist to try and get the US to intervene on our behalf in this dispute and put the disputer for international arbitration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

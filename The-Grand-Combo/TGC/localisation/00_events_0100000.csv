EVTDESC100018;A nationalist diplomat going by the name of Hassan Taqizadeh has opened a new publication with friends of his to support our cause to modernize the country. It is called ‘Kaveh’. This journal emphasizes the need for national independence, and internal reforms, especially secular and educational ones. Among Kaveh’s topics are public education, equality for women, the need for a strong central government and to control the tribes, and advocacy of sports and more translations from Western languages. This seems like a good initiative but could get out of hand. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC101533;A prominent Hungarian liberal, Lajos Kossuth, has finally been released from jail, along with other notable liberals. Since his release he has become something of a national hero to many Hungarians, and he has continued his opposition towards our government. As the editor of the Pesti Hirlap he has talked about the great economic and societal problems within Hungary, advocated full national autonomy within the Habsburg Empire, the immediate emancipation of the serfs-with no compensation to aristocrats-and an end of noble privileges. He has also promoted industrialization by founding the Gyáralapito és Kereskedelmi Társaság (Factory-Founding and Commercial Society).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC101534;We have tried to put an end to Kossuth’s hostility to our rule for some time now. His criticism of our rule in Hungary is highly influential and therefore highly damaging for us. His chief political weapon is a liberal rag, the Pesti Hirlap, in which he has been able to express his radical views. Perhaps if we were to purchase the newspaper, we could put an end to Kossuth’s ramblings?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC101535;By our refusal to ratify reforms that many Hungarians have wanted since 1825, we’ve side-lined the moderates who wanted reforms but no national autonomy. Kossuth’s articles against us in the Pesti Hirlap were the last straw and now the radicals, especially Kossuth, hold the love of the people and more importantly, the majority in Parliament. The Hungarians will not settle for anything less than an autonomous national government. Széchényi István, the very man who started the call for reforms in 1825, writes articles attacking the Pesti Hirlap and Kossuth himself, and together with the moderates, they either join the radicals or like Széchényi drift towards the conservatives. There is now no middle ground in Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC101536;Considered one of the fathers of modern Czech nation, Palacky played a leading role in the Czech cultural and national revival of the early nineteenth century. At first a proponent of Austro-Slavism, a view that advocated unification and autonomy of Slavs within the framework of the Habsburg monarchy, Palacky later called for complete Czech independence. Palacky’s greatest literary contribution was his History of Bohemia, which significantly influenced growing Czech national consciousness as it saw the history of Bohemia as a constant struggle of Germans and Slavs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC110011;The English Anglo-Persian Oil Company was the first company to extract petroleum from $COUNTRY$. In 1901 William Knox D’Arcy negotiated an oil concession with Mozaffar al-Din: he would assume exclusive rights to prospect for 60 years in a vast tract of territory and in exchange the Shah received 20,000¤, an equal amount in shares, and a promise of future profits. In early May 1908 D’Arcy, having sunk more than 500,000¤ into his Persian venture and found no oil, sent a telegram saying that they had run out of money and ordering to ‘cease work, dismiss the staff, dismantle anything worth the cost and come home.’ The geologist George Bernard Reynolds delayed following these orders and in a stroke of luck, struck oil shortly after on May 26, 1908.

EVTDESC110020;On $YEAR$, the Shah granted foreigners a concession over the production, sale, and export of tobacco for fifty years. In exchange, they paid the Shah an annual sum plus a share of the profits. A Tobacco Régie (monopoly) was subsequently established and all the producers and owners of tobacco were forced to sell their goods to agents of the Régie, who would then resell the purchased tobacco. The concession represented a major blow to Persian farmers and bazaaris whose livelihoods were largely dependent on the lucrative tobacco business. Mass protests against the Régie began to emerge in major Iranian cities, spearheaded by the bazaari. The ulema proved to be a highly valuable ally of them as key religious leaders sought to defend traditional values and protect national interests from foreign domination. The brewing discontent threatens to rip our country apart, but giving in to their demands might have even more serious consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC110028;Bazaari is the name given to the merchants and workers of bazaars, the traditional marketplaces of Iran. Bazaaris differ from a social class as usually defined in that they include both rich wholesalers and bankers as well as lower-income workers. They are united not in their resistance to dependence on the West and the spread of Western ways, their traditionalist attitude and their close family, financial, and cultural ties with the Shia ulama or clerical class. Bazaari, led by its large merchants, in alliance with ulama clergy, have played an important part in recent Iranian history. The troubles have spread and the support of the nascent entrepreneur middle-class to our traditional elites could prove fatal to the economy and the social order. They ask us to backtrack on our most recent reforms. The initial disorder has now mutated into open anarchy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC110029;In 1864 until the early 20th century, another mass expulsion took place of Caucasian Muslims as a result of the Russian victory in the Caucasian War. These migrations once again, towards Iran, included masses of Azerbaijanis, other Transcaucasian and North Caucasian Muslims, such as Circassians, Shia Lezgins and Laks. Many of these migrants would prove to play a pivotal role in further Iranian history, as they formed most of the ranks of the Persian Cossack Brigade. Formed in 1879 in Persia. It was modelled after the Caucasian Cossack regiments of the Imperial Russian Army and, until 1920, it was commanded by Russian officers. Together with a Swedish trained and officered gendarmerie, the Cossack Brigade came to comprise the most effective military force available to the Iranian crown in the years prior to World War I and its most elite cavalry unit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC110030;$MONARCHTITLE$, our authoritarian power has come through and our people are tired. The masses are in the street, asking for heads to roll and change to come, agitated by various members of different castes-religious ulama, rich bazaari and disgruntled aristocrats as well as radical thinkers-that we, for too long, encouraged by all the privileges given and motivated by the brutality of our repression. The Enghelab-e Mashruteh, the Revolution, opened the way for cataclysmic change in Persia, heralding the modern era. It saw a period of unprecedented debate in a burgeoning press, created new opportunities and opened up seemingly boundless possibilities for the future of Persia. Many different groups fought to shape the course of the Revolution, and all sections of society were ultimately to be in some way changed by it. How shall we react?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Reports of fights with the police arrive to our ears. In order to avoid the country slipping into anarchy, most regional commanders decided to have the army intervene. This, of course, only serve to further motivate the rebels. In the capital, the opposition —led by bazaari and ulama once again-sought sanctuary in a mosque in Tehran. Forcing it would risk provoking popular support to their cause.

You don’t want the details $MONARCHTITLE$. Let’s just say even the next generation will not dare raise against us.

The fields of the gigantic mansion are filled with tents where emissaries, clerics, businessmen and tribe leaders exchange, seemingly safe from our reach. We are assured that they are just fomenting their next move to strike us down! On the other hand, any actions would be perceived very badly and our diplomatic ties could suffer to the point of a war we may not afford.

They want their leaders to be nominated and that Parliament be given the right to oversee our regime’s actions. They want their right to meet, exchange and discuss be respected. They want the location itself be deemed sacred and protected from any intervention of the police or the army. They want those demands to be unconditionally accepted and sworn on the Holy Book in front of entire population… This is dangerous.

EVTDESC110036;Negotiating with the ulama appeared to be easy enough: in the grand scale of the Revolution, they agreed to let the other groups represent the secular interests.

Sukarno proposed a threefold blend of nasionalisme (‘nationalism’), agama (‘religion’), and komunisme (‘communism’) into a co-operative ‘Nas-A-Kom’ government.

While the Yankees did see them, they were unable to fight back and the Hunley launched its torpedo swinging in the flank of the 1,260-ton vessel, sinking it in less than five minutes. The men then set for home but sadly could not make it. Some think it got unintentionally rammed, others that the crew miscalculated the amount of oxygen needed.

EVTDESC110060;In $YEAR$, a number of American immigrants in Alta California raised and rebelled against the local Mexican government before seizing military control the area to the north of the San Francisco Bay, in the present-day state of California. The immigrants had not been allowed to buy or rent land and had been threatened with expulsion because Mexican officials were concerned about the incoming influx of unregulated Americans in a climate of quickly rising tensions with the US. The term ‘California Republic’ appeared on the flag the insurgents raised and indicated their aspiration of forming a republican government for California. The flag featured an image of a California grizzly bear and became known as the Bear Flag and the revolt as the Bear Flag Revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Not understanding the significance of the stool, he clearly had no inkling of the storm his words would produce: the suggestion that he, a foreigner, should sit upon and defile the Golden Stool, the very embodiment of the Ashanti state, and very symbol of the Ashanti peoples, living, dead, and yet to be born, was far too insufferable for the crowd.

EVTDESC110074;Dom Pedro II, nicknamed ‘the Magnanimous’, was the second ruler of the young Empire of Brazil. Born in Rio de Janeiro, he was a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza. His father’s abrupt abdication and departure to Europe in order to restore his daughter on the throne of Portugal left a five-year-old Pedro II as Emperor and led to a grim and lonely childhood and adolescence. Still, he grew into a man with a strong sense of duty and devotion toward his country and his people-on the other hand, he was increasingly resentful of his role as monarch. Inheriting an Empire on the verge of disintegration, he turned it into an emerging power with an important economic growth, distinguished from its neighbours on account of its political stability. Still, despite its overwhelming popular support, Pedro II quickly became weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy’s future prospects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

One day in $YEAR$, while residing in Paris, he caught an infection that progressed quickly into pneumonia Pedro rapidly declined and died surrounded by his family.

EVTDESC110078;Jack the Ripper is the best-known name given to an unidentified serial killer generally believed to have been active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in $YEAR$. Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations. The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge. The ‘From Hell’ letter received by George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee included half of a preserved human kidney, purportedly taken from one of the victims. The public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer known as ‘Jack the Ripper’, mainly because of the extraordinarily brutal character of the murders and because of media treatment of the events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The former claimed that British subjects in the Islands were being denied their legal rights: thus, when Paulet arrived at Honolulu, he requested an audience with King Kamehameha III, tensions quickly rose between the locals, their American allies and the British elites-especially after Paulet militarily occupied the Islands.

Kashef, who was the first mayor of Tehran and an Iranian ambassador to India under British rule, knew that the British would not allow him to learn about the secrets of tea production, as it was it is their biggest business in India. So being fluent in French, the prince pretended to be a French labourer and started to work in the tea plantations and factories to learn how to produce tea. Ultimately his plan was to take back some samples of this tea to $COUNTRY$ to cultivate. He was successful in this endeavour only because of his diplomatic immunity which stopped the British from searching his secretly stashed sample. At the time, Kashef brought 3000 saplings into his country from the Northern part of India, Kangra and he started the cultivation in the region Gilan, south of the Caspian Sea.

Now he is being shuffled about, moved from one parish to another, in order to cover up the story and secure the church’s reputation.

The local government has turned a blind eye to the whole matter and let the attacks of retribution be carried out. Many people in $STATENAME$ are now calling for severe restrictions to be placed upon the minorities in the nation.

The minorities have little legal recourse as their rights are almost non-existent. Recently, a family of immigrants who were wrongfully evicted from their residence died from exposure during an extremely cold night. Newspapers have picked up the story and are inflaming public opinion against our residency laws. We could let the anti-residency sentiments grow,’ or we could pay off some newspapers to run an opposing story detailing the ‘‘uncouth and devious’’ nature of the minority’s culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

A particularly racist and sharply divided town in $STATENAME$ has voted in a series of laws that effectively bans a large minority’s most important cultural festival. The laws probably would not have garnered enough votes if cultural minorities were allowed to vote. The debate about spreading full citizenship to minorities is raging among the state’s newspapers and those in favour of full citizenship seem to be gaining the most sympathy. To stop this movement, we could stage an arson attack on the racist town’s city hall and make it look like the minority was behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

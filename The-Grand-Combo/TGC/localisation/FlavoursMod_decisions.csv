begin_pax_britannica_desc;Latin for 'British Peace'\n\n The Napoleonic Wars left Great Britain as the most powerful naval country in the world, with no meaningful rivals. The country's economic and strategic strength was buttressed by the fleet, localized military action was a staple of the not-entirely-peaceful 'Pax Britannica'. In addition, the threat of naval force was a significant factor in diplomacy. \n\nDuring the late 19th century, Britain's primary goal in foreign policy was to maintain the balance of power in Europe and to intervene if that balance was upset. Its secondary goal was to protect its overseas interest in the colonies and dominions, as free trade kept the Empire alive. The sea routes to the colonies, especially those linking Britain to India were vital. \n\n§RNOTE: This will cause Britain to reject all alliances with great powers unless it is threatened by another rising great power.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

singapore_strategy_title;The Singapore Strategy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
singapore_strategy_desc;The Singapore strategy was a naval defence policy of the British Empire that evolved in a series of war plans from 1919 to 1941. It aimed to deter aggression by the Empire of Japan by providing for a base for a fleet of the Royal Navy in the Far East, able to intercept and defeat a Japanese force heading south towards India or Australia. To be effective it required a well-equipped base; Singapore, at the eastern end of the Strait of Malacca, was chosen in 1919 as the location of this base; work continued on this naval base and its defences over the next two decades. The planners envisaged that a war with Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make its way from home waters to Singapore, sally to relieve or recapture Hong Kong, and blockade the Japanese home islands to force Japan to accept terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The port was primarily used as a summer anchorage for the Royal Navy's China Station and it was also used as a health resort. It served as a port of call for ships of the Royal Navy in the Far East (well behind Hong Kong in the south). Certain aspects of the administration not directly pertaining to military matters were left under Chinese control, and the port itself remained a free port until 1923.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim was to maintain the status quo, the sovereignty of France over its North African colonies. Five years later, in 1875, this was confirmed in the framework of the Code de l'indigenat. \n\n The decree allowed for native Jews to automatically become French citizens while Muslim Arabs and Berbers were excluded and remained under the second-class indigenous status outlined in the Code de l'Indigenat. They could, on paper, request French citizenship, but requests were very seldom accepted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The ruling family's persistent financial problems became especially acute after the loss of tax revenue from two breakaway towns, Menton and Roquebrune, which declared independence from Monaco in 1848 and refused to pay taxes on olive oil and fruit imposed by the Grimaldis. \nIn 1854, Charles, Florestan's son and future Prince of Monaco, recruited a team of Frenchmenwriter Albert Aubert and businessman Napoleon Langloisto devise a development plan and write a prospectus to attract 4 million francs needed to build a spa for the treatment of various diseases, a gambling casino modeled from the Bad Homburg casino, and English-styled villas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

imperial_japanese_navy_title;Opinions Regarding Naval Expansion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imperial_japanese_navy_desc;Japanese statesman Iwakura Tomomi submitted a document to the Dajokan titled "Opinions Regarding Naval Expansion asserting that a strong navy was essential to maintaining the security of Japan. In furthering his argument, Iwakura suggested that domestic rebellions was no longer Japan's primary military concern and that that naval affairs should take precedence over army concerns; a strong navy was more important than a sizable army to preserve the Japanese state. Furthermore, he justified that a large, modern navy, would have the added potential benefit of instilling Japan with greater international prestige and recognition, as navies were internationally recognized hallmarks of power and status. Iwakura also suggested that the Meiji government could support naval growth by increasing taxes on tobacco, sake, and soy. After lengthy discussions, Iwakura eventually convinced the ruling coalition to support Japan's first multi-year naval expansion plan in history.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

form_mittelafrika_desc;Mittelafrika ("Middle Africa") is the name created for a geostrategic region in central and east Africa. Much like Mitteleuropa, it articulated Germany's foreign policy aims at the end of the long 19th century. The difference between the two was that Mittelafrika would be an agglomeration of German colonies in Africa, while Mitteleuropa was conceptualised as a geostrategic buffer zone between Germany and Russia to be filled with puppet states. \n\nGerman strategic thinking was that if the region between the colonies of German East Africa, German South-West Africa, and Cameroon could be annexed, a contiguous entity could be created covering the breadth of the African continent from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. Given the richness in natural resources of the Belgian Congo alone, this region would accrue considerable wealth to the colonising power through the exploitation of natural resources, as well as contributing to another German aim of economic self-sufficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,er German aim of economic self-sufficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

establish_panslavism_rus_desc;Pan-Slavism, a movement which crystallized in the mid-19th century, is the political ideology concerned with the advancement of integrity and unity for the Slavic-speaking peoples. Its main impact occurred in the Balkans, where non-Slavic empiresthe Byzantine Empire, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Venicehad ruled the South Slavs for centuries. \n\nExtensive pan-Slavism began much like Pan-Germanism, both of which grew from the sense of unity and nationalism experienced within ethnic groups after the French Revolution and the consequent Napoleonic Wars against European monarchies. Like other Romantic nationalist movements, Slavic intellectuals and scholars in the developing fields of history, philology, and folklore actively encouraged the passion of their shared identity and ancestry. Pan-Slavism also co-existed with the Southern Slavic independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These were converted from hereditary governors to appointed governmental posts, as had been done by Chinese Yuan, Ming, and Qing-era rulers in first recognizing Tusi (tribal leaders) as imperial officials, then replacing them with imperial appointees. The arrangement resulted in governors being appointed and paid by the central government, and mueang developed into provinces. \n\nResistance to these reforms would cause uprisings by traditional local leaders around the Kingdom for many years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

british_sierra_leone_desc;In 1787, British philanthropists founded the Province of Freedom which later became Freetown, a British crown colony and the principal base for the suppression of the slave trade, it was only a small colony encompassing roughly the 30-km-long peninsula on which Freetown is located.\n\nInitially, the British and Creoles (freed slaves and their descendents) of the Freetown colony had only a very limited involvement in the affairs of the African kingdoms around them; such as it was, it consisted mostly of trading and missionary activity. Over the course of the 19th century this involvement gradually increased. The colonial government was, in particular, interested in fostering trade as this provided it with its main source of revenue, in the form of customs duties and other taxes. This inevitably drew it into engagement with the African kingdoms, mainly by making treaties with the kingdoms or sending military expeditions against them.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

support_troupes_de_marine_desc;The colonial expansion of the 19th century saw the extensive use of French sailors and marines serving together in South-East Asia, in the Pacific and West Africa. Throughout their changing titles and roles the French Troupes de Marine or Troupes coloniales retained a reputation for toughness and professionalism. Whether French or indigenous they were, for the most part, long service regulars and as such comprised a genuine elite. They were recruited from mainland France or from the French settler and indigenous populations of the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ethische_politiek_desc;The Dutch Ethische Politiek (Ethical Policy) was the official policy of colonial government of Indonesia during the four decades from $YEAR$. 1901, the Dutch Queen Wilhelmina announced that the Netherlands accepted an ethical responsibility for the welfare of their colonial subjects. This announcement was a sharp contrast with the former official doctrine that Indonesia was a wingewest (region for making profit). The Ethical Policy promoted efforts to improve the lot of the ordinary people through irrigation programmes, the introduction of banking services for the native population, and subsidies for native industries and handicrafts.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reforms_of_abdulmejid_i_title;Military Reforms of Abdulmejid I;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reforms_of_abdulmejid_i_desc;Sultan Abdulmejid I enjoyed several years of peace, which enabled him to form a powerful and well disciplined army that was established at the beginning of the year $YEAR$.\n\nThe chain-of-command in the general staff of each army was composed of a commander-in-chief, two lieutenant-generals, three brigadiers of infantry, one of whom commands the reserve, two brigadiers of cavalry, and one brigadier of artillery. In each corps there were three regiments of infantry, two of cavalry, and one of artillery, with thirty-three guns. The total strength of these twelve regiments of active forces was 30,000 men, but it was diminished in time of peace by furlough to an effective strength of about 25,000 men in three of the six armies, as well as 15,000 troops in the other three, a consequence of the recruiting system being as yet incomplete in its application all over the Ottoman Empire. The whole establishment of this branch amounts, therefore, to 180,000 men, belonging to the active service, but its effective strength is at present 123,000.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

reforms_of_abdul_hamid_ii_desc;Abdul Hamid II was the 34th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. He oversaw a period of decline, with rebellions, particularly in the Balkans, he suspended both the Ottoman  constitution and Parliament in $YEAR$ and accomplished highly effective power and control. \n\nModernization of the Ottoman Empire occurred during his reign, including reform of the bureaucracy, the extension of the Rumelia Railway and Anatolia Railway and the construction of the Baghdad Railway and Hejaz Railway. In addition, a system for population registration and control over the press was established along with the first local modern law school in 1898. The most far-reaching of these reforms were in education: many professional schools were established, including Law School, School of Arts, School of Trades, Civil Engineering School, The Veterinarian School, The Customs School, The Farming School, The Linguistic School, and more.\n\nAbdul Hamid II attached utmost importance to the reorganization of the military. As early as 1880 he sought, and two years later secured, German assistance, which culminated in the appointment of Lt. Col. Kohlcr and, finally, Colmar Von der Goltz as military advisors.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ottoman_national_anthemn_title;The Imperial Anthemn of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ottoman_national_anthemn_desc;The Ottoman Empire used anthems since its foundation in the late 13th century, but did not use a specific imperial or national anthem until the 19th century. During the reign of Mahmud II, when the military and imperial band were re-organized along Western lines, Giuseppe Donizetti was invited to head the process. Donizetti Pasha, as he was known in the Ottoman Empire, composed the first Western-style imperial anthem, the Mahmudiye Marsi.\n\nLike in many other monarchies of its time, the anthem of the Ottoman Empire was an imperial anthem, not a national one. Hence it paid homage to a specific ruler and a new anthem was composed at each imperial succession. However, in $YEAR$, with the Tanzimat reforms, the Mecidiye Marsi was recognized as the first official Ottoman national anthem. The first official Ottoman national flag (which was in essence identical to the present-day Turkish flag) was also adopted in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

jamaican_crown_colony_desc;Although the black uprising of the Morant Bay rebellion had been ruthlessly suppressed, the severe rioting so alarmed the white jamaican planters that the two-centuries-old assembly voted to abolish itself and asked for the establishment of direct British rule.\n\nIn $YEAR$ the new Crown colony government consisted of the Legislative Council and the executive Privy Council containing members of both chambers of the House of Assembly, but the Colonial Office exercised effective power through a presiding British governor. The council included a few handpicked prominent Jamaicans for the sake of appearance only. In the late nineteenth century, Crown colony rule was modified; representation and limited self-rule were reintroduced gradually into Jamaica. The colony's legal structure was reformed along the lines of English common law and county courts, and a constabulary force was established.\n\nThe smooth working of the Crown colony system was dependent on a good understanding and an identity of interests between the governing officials, who were British, and most of the nonofficial, nominated members of the Legislative Council, who were Jamaicans. The elected members of this body were in a permanent minority and without any influence or administrative power. The unstated alliance  based on shared color, attitudes, and interest  between the British officials and the Jamaican upper class was reinforced in London, where the West India Committee lobbied for Jamaican interests. Jamaica's white or near-white propertied class continued to hold the dominant position in every respect; the vast majority of the black population remained poor and unenfranchised.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

banjarmasin_war_desc;Since 1606 the East United India Company maintained contacts with the island of Borneo. In 1635 the first contract was signed with the Sultanate of Banjarmasin for the provision of pepper - at the time, a luxury product in Europe and a major reason for the Dutch interest in this region. Over the years, effective power in the Sultanate was increasingly taken up by the Dutch Resident.\n\nIn 1852 the Sultan's heir-apparent died, and the Dutch replaced him by the illegitimate grandson Tamjied Illah. In vain, Sultan Adam and many nobles sent an emissary to Batavia, pointing out iniquities perpetrated by the Dutch-designated heir and appealing for the Dutch to recognise instead Hidayatullah - a younger but legitimate son.\n\nSultan Adam soon died and was succeeded by the illegitimate Tamjied Illah. There ensued a struggle for power between Tamjied Illah and Hidayatullah, which divided the population, much of which stood behind Hidayatullah and highly resented the Dutch sponsoring of Tamjied Illah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mosquito_protectorate_desc;In $YEAR$ the British government declared a new protectorate over the Mosquito Kingdom and appointed a Consul-General of the Mosquito Coast, Patrick Walker with seat in Bluefields. The proclamation was motivated by the state of anarchy in the Mosquito Kingdom after the death of Robert Charles Frederic, but also by the impending American annexation of Texas and the British desire to build a canal through Central America before the United States did.\n\nThe protectorate was claimed to extend from Cape Honduras in the north to the mouth of the San Juan River in the south, including San Juan del Norte. Nicaragua protested again and sent forces to San Juan del Norte, which the Miskito King George Augustus Frederic II replied to with an ultimatum demanding all Nicaraguan forces to leave the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During a visit of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Resident's visit to Penyengat, the sultan then, on his own authority and without $COUNTRY_ADJ$ approval, summoned local Malay rulers, making the Resident feel as if he was being besieged by the sultanate. \n\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ is clear, this defiance by the sultan must be punished, the Riau-Lingga Sultanate must be dissolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
